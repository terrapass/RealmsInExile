 commerce_inv_3:0 "Lighthouses"
 commerce_inv_3_desc:0 "Construction of lighthouses is an absolute necessity to keep the flow of trade safe in our nation. The concept of lighthouses developed from simple hill-fires, to grand edifices such as the lighthouses built by the ancient Númenóreans."
 commerce_inv_4:0 "Regulated Money Lenders"
 commerce_inv_4_desc:0 "The plight of the poor is rarely relieved by money lenders, but we must accept that they are a necessary evil. Instituting financial regulations, however, may at least let us profit from them."
 commerce_inv_5:0 "Mandated Record Keeping"
 commerce_inv_5_desc:0 "In ancient Númenor, the keeping of records by dedicated scribes and archivists was a legal requirement. Being able to track the flow of revenue is a necessity for a functioning bureaucracy."

 state_trade_inv_3:0 "Encourage Exploration"
 state_trade_inv_3_desc:0 "Though the west is off-limits, there are still unknown lands to the east - by encouraging our brave citizens to venture further afield, we can flood our market with exotic items of all kinds."
 capital_trade_inv_1:0 "River Barges"
 capital_trade_inv_1_desc:0 "The needs of our capital must be served - operating regular grain barges from the coast to the point nearest our capital will alleviate some of the burden on private traders."
 capital_trade_inv_2:0 "Logistics Bureau"
 capital_trade_inv_2_desc:0 "Our burgeoning state is beginning to struggle under its own weight. A dedicated logistics administration must be instituted to handle the flow of traders and merchants into our capital."

 global_tax_modifier_inv_5_desc:0 "Many Númenórean realms imposed a tax on the import and export of goods. In the Third Age, former colonies such as Umbar and Bellakar were forced to re-evaluate their trade relationships with each other and formerly subservient neighbours."

 research_points_modifier_inv_5_desc:0 "The various schools of philosophy arising out of Númenor's colonies, and further afield, combine mathematics, theology, cosmology, and much more, to create a distinct world view.

 global_citizen_output_inv_3:0 "Waste Disposal Infrastructure"
 global_citizen_output_inv_3_desc:0 "Developed in eons past, the idea of a unified waste disposal architecture is still a lofty goal. Clean streets, and public bathhouses are sure to increase the quality of living."

 global_slaves_output_inv_5_desc:0 "In the worst cases, bodily punishment or execution may be employed to keep the lower classes in line. Whilst crimes would have to be severe to incur such a penalty, witnessing this punishment must have had a severe psychological effect."

 global_tribesmen_output_inv_3:0 "Land Tithe"
 global_tribesmen_output_inv_3_desc:0 "Tolerating foreign tribesmen on our land can make some uneasy, but the institution of a tithe on the land they occupy is likely to calm those voices and earn us a pretty penny in the meantime."

 global_tribesmen_output_inv_5:0 "Right to Religious Observance"
 global_tribesmen_output_inv_5_desc:0 "In most cases, the religion that any given tribe practices is of no consequence to us. Therefore, giving them limited protection over the rights to practice exotic beliefs is a small price to pay for their security."

 move_pop_cost_modifier_inv:0 "Colonisation"
 move_pop_cost_modifier_inv_desc:0 "The Númenórean colonisation of much of the known world was a classic example of the practice that had been employed by their sucessors since. Granting land to soldiers and their families acted as a standing garrison in recently conquered territories."
 convert_pop_cost_modifier_inv:0 "Assimilation"
 convert_pop_cost_modifier_inv_desc:0 "The practice of integrating foreign beliefs into the greater structure of our own practices makes it much easier to assimilate distrustful foreigners into our realm."

 stability_inv_3:0 "Proper Burials"
 stability_inv_3_desc:0 "It is the final duty the living to offer the dead a measure of dignity and to commemorate their passing. The nobility of Eriador are famous for their immense stone cairns and tombs, while in other lands the dead are sent on via more unusual methods.

 global_population_growth_inv_2:0 "Agricultural Wisdom"
 global_population_growth_inv_2_desc:0 "One does not simply cut and tear at the earth, and expect to reap a harvest. The land must be understood to be worked with, as if with a partner, not an enemy. And whatever you do, don't burn down the old forests."
 global_population_growth_inv_3:0 "Obstetrics"

 omen_duration_inv_2:0 "Loreseeking"
