 ### SARUMAN EVENTS ###
 saruman.0001.t:0 "The Lord of Isengard"
 saruman.0001.desc:0 "Isengard was not made by you, but by the Men of Númenor long ago; it is very tall and has many secrets; yet it looks not to be a work of craft.\n\nIt was at the crowning of Fréaláf King of the Riddermark, that you appeared, bringing gifts, and speaking great praise of the valour of the Rohirrim. All knew you a welcome guest. Soon after you took up your abode in Isengard, for Beren, the Steward of Minas Tirith, had gave you the keys to Orthanc; and from that year on 2759 T3A you have dwelt in Isengard.\n\nYou became a lord of Men; for at first you held Isengard as a lieutenant of the Steward and warden of the tower. Fréaláf was as glad as Beren to have this so, and know that Isengard was in the hands of a strong friend. A friend you long were, and you kept the tower as part of the defences of the West, so long as you yourself remained the chief person in that defence, and the head of its council.\n\nYour subjects are mixed Rohirrim and Dunlending, and no longer do you consider the realm of Gondor as your liege."
 saruman.0001.a:0 "The rule of Isengard is now mine, as are its secrets."
 saruman.0001.a.tt:0 "You are no longer a vassal of the Lord of Minas Tirith."
 saruman.0001.b:0 "I shall remain a vassal of the Lord Denethor of Minas Tirith."
 saruman.0001.b.tt:0 "You remain a vassal of the Lord of Minas Tirith."

 saruman.0002.t:0 "The Orthanc Stone"
 saruman.0002.desc:0 "In the middle of your throne-room is a black stand. On it, a black cloth covering the palantír, the greatest of the secrets of Isengard.\n\nGandalf would advise you to disregard its power. The grey fool miscalculates your wisdom and strength.\n\nSauron has a palantír, the captured Ithil Stone of Minas Ithil, that is guessed correctly by you. You have felt his gaze on Isengard. But you are powerful enough to resist him and you shroud your valley in secrecy from his eye.\n\nIn this hour you will wrestle with Sauron and claim mastery over this powerful tool to use it in your quest."
 saruman.0002.a:0 "I will find the One Ring. And bring order to Middle-earth."
 saruman.0002.a.tt:0 "You gaze into the palantír."
 saruman.0002.b:0 "To gaze into the palantír is folly; Sauron seeks me."
 saruman.0002.b.tt:0 "You do not gaze into the palantír yet."
 
 saruman.0003.t:0 "The palantír"
 saruman.0003.desc:0 "In the darkness of your throne room, the black cloth is lifted, you reach out towards the crystal ball and command it to show you the One Ring. It respects your power and sweeps over the Gladden Fields. The scene is visible, wilderness of marshlands, the Gladden Fields, where you have searched ceaselessly to discover the Ring. It is not there. You search further and are directed over Mirkwood and towards the Sea of Rhûn, where you observe the endless armies of the Men of Rhûn, but someone else is watching.\n\nSauron has found you; concealed within his fortress, the Lord of Mordor sees all with the captured Ithil Stone, palantír of Minas Ithil. His form is a great eye, lidless, wreathed in flame. His reaching flames pierce through the palantír and drive into your arms, he is seeking to learn your designs. The vision of the palantír shifts to scenes of Sauron’s utter conquest of the east and south. Sauron does not know yet of your purpose, but you must either deceive him or fight for control of the palantír."
 saruman.0003.a:0 "Saruman pledges allegiance to you, lord Sauron."
 saruman.0003.a.tt:0 = "Pledge allegiance to Sauron, convert to the Counsels of Sauron. Continue your search to claim the One Ring."
 saruman.0003.b:0 "You shall not have the Orthanc Stone, Dark Lord."
 saruman.0003.a.tt:0 "Strive against Sauron, wrest control over the Orthanc Stone."
 
 saruman.0004.t:0 "Decision: The palantír"
 
 
 
 
 saruman.0010.t:0 "The Wizard's New Clothes"
 saruman.0010.desc:0 "“White!” you sneer. “It serves as a beginning. White cloth may be dyed. The white page can be overwritten; and the white light can be broken.”\n\nYou are the head of the Istari, sent to bring order to this Middle-earth.\n\nThe wisest of the Wise. And it was you, who had diligently sought after the One Ring, your purpose: to retrieve it before Sauron claims it. All of Middle-earth will praise the Many Coloured when you hold the Ruling Ring. And you will usher in a new era of peace and prosperity.\n\n“For I am Saruman the Wise!”"
 saruman.0010.a:0 "Saruman of Many Colours!"
 saruman.0010.b:0 "I prefer white better."
 saruman.0010.b.tt:0 "As chief of the Istari you have a responsibility to stay within style-guides set by the Valar."
 
 
 
 saruman.0040.t:0 "In the Council of Sauron"
 saruman.0040.desc:0 "“Build me an army worthy of Mordor.”\n\nThrough the palantír, Sauron has ordered you to contact the orcs of the Misty Mountains. They are skilled in metallurgy and in the ranks of warriors at your disposal. In their ranks are veterans of the Battle of the Five Armies."
 saruman.0040.a:0 "We have work to do."
 saruman.0040.a.tt:0 "Lord Sauron commands you to summon orcs from the Misty Mountains."
 saruman.0040.b:0 "The Dunlendings will serve Isengard better."
 saruman.0040.b.tt:0 "Summon Wildmen from Dunland."

 saruman.0041.t:0 "The Gardens of Isengard."
 saruman.0041.desc:0 "You have evicted the fortress of Isengard of your human subjects. You have no need for them in your designs and they would not take well with orc company.\n\nThey toil under night, despoiling the Númenórean gardens and tearing down trees.\n\n“The trees are strong my lord, their roots go deep.”"
 saruman.0041.a:0 "Rip them all down."
 
 saruman.0042.t:0 "The Industry of Isengard"
 saruman.0042.desc:0 "The old world will burn in the fires of Industry; forests will fall, a new order will rise; we will drive the machine of war with the sword and the spear and the iron fist of the orc.\n\nTo the orc chieftain, now overseer of this operation you command: “I want them armed and ready to march within two weeks.”\n\n“But my lord”, he grovels, “there are too many, they cannot all be armed in time, we don’t have the means.”\n\nYour patience is thin, through clenched teeth you make orders, “Build a dam, block the stream, work the furnaces night and day.”\n\nThe orc spits out his excuse, “we don’t have enough fuel to feed the fires.”\n\nIsengard has been stripped bare, but there is an ancient forest nearby in which you once roamed."
 saruman.0042.a:0 "The forest of Fangorn lies on our doorstep. Burn it!"
 #\n\nIn service to Sauron you have delved into the deep storehouses, the Númenóreans could hold an army of thousands inside the ring of Isengard, you will hold an army of tens of thousands.

 saruman.0045.t:0 "Union of the Two Towers"
 saruman.0045.desc:0 "You contact Sauron again; he shows you the might of Barad-dur, it stands high above the volcanic wasteland, tower upon tower, battlement upon battlement, black, immeasurably strong. So too is the tower of Isengard, unassailable in its valley, a worthy holding and vassal of the Dark Lord.\n\n“The world is changing. Who now has the strength to stand against the power of Isengard and Mordor. To stand against the might of Sauron and Saruman and the union of the two towers?”"
 saruman.0045.a:0 "Together, my lord Sauron, we shall rule the Middle-earth."
