 # Saruman events
 saruman.0001.t:0 "The Orthanc Stone"
 saruman.0001.desc:0 "Isengard was not made by you, but by the Men of Númenor long ago; it is very tall and has many secrets; yet it looks not to be a work of craft.\n\nIt was at the crowning of Fréaláf King of the Riddermark, that you appeared, bringing gifts, and speaking great praise of the valour of the Rohirrim. All knew you a welcome guest. Soon after you took up your abode in Isengard, for Beren, the Steward of Minas Tirith, had gave you the keys to Orthanc; and from that year on 2759 T3A you have dwelt in Isengard.\n\nYou became a lord of Men; for at first you held Isengard as a lieutenant of the Steward and warden of the tower. Fréaláf was as glad as Beren to have this so, and know that Isengard was in the hands of a strong friend. A friend you long were, and you kept the tower as part of the defences of the West, so long as you yourself remained the chief person in that defences, and the head of its council.\n\nYour subjects are mixed Rohirrim and Dunlending, and no longer do you consider the realm of Gondor as your liege. The rule of Isengard is yours.\n\nIn the middle of your throne-room is a black stand. On it, a black cloth covering the palantír, the greatest of the secrets of Isengard.\n\nGandalf would advise you to disregard its power. The grey fool miscalculates your wisdom and strength. Sauron has a palantír, that is known. You have felt his gaze on Orthanc and on this very room. But you are powerful enough to resist him, to strive against his will and wrestle the palantír from his control. In this hour you will claim mastery over this powerful tool and use it to seek for the One Ring.\n\nIn the darkness of your throne room, the black cloth is lifted, you reach out towards the crystal ball and command it to show you the One Ring. It respects your power and sweeps over the Gladden Fields. The scene is visible, wilderness of marshlands that is doubtless the Gladden Fields, were you have searched ceaselessly to discover the ring. It is not there. You search further and are directed over Mirkwood and towards the Sea of Rhûn, where you observe the endless armies of the Men of Rhûn, but someone else is watching.\n\nSauron has found you; concealed within his fortress, the Lord of Mordor sees all with the captured Ithil Stone, palantír of Minas Ithil. His form is a great eye, lidless, wreathed in flame. The reaching flames pierce through the palantír and pierce into your arms, he is seeking to learn your designs. The vision of the palantír shifts to scenes of Sauron’s utter conquest of the east and south. Sauron does not know yet of your purpose, but you must either deceive him or fight for control of the palantír."
 saruman.0001.a:0 "Saruman pledges alligence to you, lord Sauron."
 saruman.0001.a.tt:0 = "Pledge alligence to Sauron, convert to the Counsels of Sauron. Continue your search to claim the One Ring."
 saruman.0001.b:0 "You shall not have the Orthanc Stone, Dark Lord."
 saruman.0001.a.tt:0 "Strive against Sauron, wrest control over the Orthanc Stone."
 saruman.0002.t:0 "The Wizard's New Clothes"
 saruman.0002.desc:0 "“White!” you sneer. “It serves as a beginning. White cloth may be dyed. The white page can be overwritten; and the white light can be broken.”\n\nYou are the head of the Istari, sent to bring order to this Middle-earth.\n\nThe wisest of the Wise. And it was you, who had diligently sought after the Ring of Power, your purpose: to retrieve it before Sauron claims it. All of Middle-earth will praise the Many Coloured when you hold the Ruling Ring. And you will usher in a new era of peace and prosperity.\n\n“For I am Saruman the Wise!”"
 saruman.0002.a:0 "Saruman of Many Colours!"
 "Build me an army, worthy of Mordor."
 saruman.0005.t:0 "Union of the Two Towers"
 saruman.0005.desc:0 "You contact Sauron again; he shows you the might of Barad-dur, it stands tower upon tower, battlement upon battlement, black, immeasurably strong. So too is the tower of Isengard, unassailable in its valley, a worthy holding of the Dark Lord.\n\n“The world is changing. Who now has the strength to stand against the strength of Isengard and Mordor. To stand against the might of Sauron and Saruman and the union of the two towers?”"
 saruman.0005.a:0 "“Together, my lord Sauron, we shall rule the Middle-earth.”"
