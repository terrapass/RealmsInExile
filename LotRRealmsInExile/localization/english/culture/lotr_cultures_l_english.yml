Seen from every corner, Rohan is a rich and pleasant region, full of life and quick to welcome the return of each spring.

In the year 2940 they were scattered by a host of Orcs, and many of them fled the North, settling in the Field of Celebrant and Dwarrowhall.\n\nSome have crossed the Limlight into Rohan, to settle in the northern downs of the Wold. They keep close to the shores of the Great River, working with bands of outlaws and pludering Orcs to smuggle stolen horses across the Anduin."
