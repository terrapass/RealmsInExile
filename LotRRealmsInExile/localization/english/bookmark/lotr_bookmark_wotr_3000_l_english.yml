 bm_3000_wotr_desc:0 "“The board is set, and the pieces are moving. But the Enemy has the move, and he is about to open his full game.” Gandalf the Grey.\n\n“So we come to it in the end, the great battle of our time, in which many things shall pass away.” Théoden King.\n\nThe great War of the Ring concludes the Third Age.\n\nThe Dark Lord Sauron holds the military advantage in this Battle for Middle-earth. At all times he has overwhelming armies of Orcs and Trolls in Mordor and Dol Guldur, and the subjugated Men of Rhûn, Haradwaith, Umbar and Khand march under his threat. For Sauron, he needs only the Ring to conquer all and cover the lands in a second darkness.\n\nOf greatest importance to the freedom of Middle-earth is the destruction of the One Ring. The hope of the Free Peoples is in Bilbo Baggins of Bag End, who holds the Ring, and in his nephew and heir, Frodo Baggins. The Wise must achieve possession of the Ring and take it to Mount Doom in Mordor, there to destroy it. As it holds much of Sauron’s native power, unmaking the Ring would defeat its creator once and for all."

 bookmark_wotr_saruman_desc:0 "Saruman is an emissary of the Valar to Middle-earth; he is great among the Wise, chief of the order of the Istari and head of the White Council.\n\nA greater length of his time in Middle-earth has been in the east, traveling the lands of Rhûn, and beyond, even to Mordor whilst Gondor kept watch over it. In 2463 T3A, the White Council was formed in response to the growing threat of Sauron’s return. He spent years in Minas Tirith, Gondor, studying in its libraries and examining its ancient archives before offering his service to the Steward of Minas Tirith as keeper of Isengard.\n\nIn secret, Saruman seeks the One Ring, and starts the new millennium with a choice before him."
 # NOTE Alternative text: "Saruman came to Middle-earth two thousand years ago as a servant of the Valar and sent alongside other Maiar known as the Istari. He has been growing in power and is now corrupted by ambition, jealousy and pride.\n\nResiding in Orthanc, Saruman has long searched for the One Ring as he hopes to make its power his own. And by communicating with Saruon through the palantír he has truly fallen into shadow. Now a servant of darkness, Saruman has bought the loyalty of King Théoden’s advisor Gríma, who he hopes shall help him weaken Rohan." - edited from Julius Ceaser
