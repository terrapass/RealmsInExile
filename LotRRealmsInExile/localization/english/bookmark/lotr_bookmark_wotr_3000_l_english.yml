 bm_3000_wotr_desc:0 "“The board is set, and the pieces are moving. But the Enemy has the move, and he is about to open his full game.” Gandalf the Grey.\n\n“So we come to it in the end, the great battle of our time, in which many things shall pass away.” Théoden King.\n\nThe great War of the Ring concludes the Third Age.\n\nThe Dark Lord Sauron holds the military advantage in this Battle for Middle-earth. At all times he has overwhelming armies of Orcs and Trolls in Mordor and Dol Guldur, and the subjugated Men of Rhûn, Haradwaith, Umbar and Khand march under his threat. For Sauron, he needs only the Ring to conquer all and cover the lands in a second darkness.\n\nOf greatest importance to the freedom of Middle-earth is the destruction of the One Ring. The hope of the Free Peoples is in Bilbo Baggins of Bag End, who holds the Ring, and in his nephew and heir, Frodo Baggins. The Wise must achieve possession of the Ring and take it to Mount Doom in Mordor, there to destroy it. As it holds much of Sauron’s native power, unmaking the Ring would defeat its creator once and for all."
