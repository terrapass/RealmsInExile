[h1]Return of the Crusader King[/h1]
G’day and welcome to the Realms in Exile mod for Crusader Kings III, Paradox’s great grand strategy game. I am part of an incredible team that has heeded the call for adventure into Middle-earth! Together we are brining the immersive world of Middle-earth to CK3, full of the diverse characters in J. R. R. Tolkien’s The Lord of the Rings.

[QUOTE]“I wisely started with a map, and made the story fit
(generally with meticulous care for distances).”[/QUOTE] – J.R.R. Tolkien.

Realms 2.2 is a major release, the mapping scope has more than doubled the size of Middle-earth between releases. For that achievement into Far Harad, it is the work of the Realms development team. We were delighted to be awarded Top 5 New Mods of 2020-2021 and be placed in the Top 100 Mods of 2021 and are very grateful to the Realms community. Crusader Kings 3 is very deserving of recognition for its modding communities.

[QUOTE]Realms in Exile refers to the kingdoms that formed after the destruction of the isle of Númenor. These are Arnor, Gondor, Umbar, Bellakar and Thôn an-Khârlôkh. Gondor features in the third book of The Lord of the Rings. It is ruled by the stewards of Minas Tirith, as their king was lost in a duel with the Witch King of Minas Morgul. Arnor is the lost realm of the north, Aragorn is chieftain of its few survivors. Umbar was once a city of the Númenóreans at the height of their power in Middle-earth, now it is a mighty haven of corsairs. Bellakar and Thôn an-Khârlôkh are former colonies, far to the south, and the books do not mention their names.[/QUOTE]

[h1]Features[/h1]
We plan to release Realms 2.2 before the release of the Royal Court Expansion DLC, and after, release Realms 2.3 to provide compatibility with the newly released DLC.
