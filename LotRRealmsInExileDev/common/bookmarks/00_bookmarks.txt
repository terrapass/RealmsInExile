	#	Closer to WotR date 11361.9.23 Gandalf leaves Rohan. Frodo leaves Bag End.
	#	WotR itself will need to be extended to about 10-30 years ingame.
	#	Maybe start in 3000 and kick off the events in 3010?
	#		Have Balin still in Moria.
	#		With a smaller map Sauron will get as many event armies as he needs.
