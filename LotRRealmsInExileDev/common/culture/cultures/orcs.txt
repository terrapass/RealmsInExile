### A RUINED FORM OF LIFE ###
# Creatures created by Melkor from the corruption of Elves.
# They are monsterous creatures and fully given over to evil.

# In Realms they are reminiscent of no real-world humans.

# There are diverse, and whilst some of their species has been
# cross-bred with other species, the process does not come
# into the game much, if at all.

# Without the influence of a Dark Lord they have their own
# unique cultures, their nature is still evil. Imagine the
# good characters of the Shadow of Mordor video game series.	# "good"



# In the First Age there were three cultural groups of Orcs.
# One trait that they all shared is a disadvantage to sunlight.

#	Corrupted Elves
#		Elves that have been tormented to the extreme and
#		retain none, or very little of themselves.
#	Boldogs
#		Maia who have taken the form of Orcs.
#	Orcs
#		Utumno Orcs
#			The demon orcs of hell. Those that may remain
#			in later Ages retain the gifts of the elves and
#			are comparable in strength to the Elvish lords.
#			Some have Maia blood.
#			Character: Ogg "Bow of Morgoth", who is immortal.
#		Angband Orcs
#			In later Ages only those most cunning survived
#			deep underground in the dark.
#		Mountain Orcs
#			Wild orcs of this time, not under servitude to
#			Melkor. This name is shared with the cultural
#			group used in T2A to T3A Realms.



# After the destruction of Angband and the banishment of
# Melkor, the orcs were diminished and hunted. The largest
# groups that survived lived in the east, few had moved south
# of Mordor or the unamed far east fortress. In Mordor and
# other eastern fortresses, Sauron gathered many orcs, many
# more lived in the northern mountains.

# In the Third Age, Sauron unleashed his necrotic powers,
# and alongside orcs he gathered wights, formless maia and
# elvish spirits either corrupted or enslaved.

# By the time of his return to Mordor, Sauron had created two
# hybrid species known as the Uruks and Olog-hai, he would
# keep these creatures in Mordor.

# By the time of the War of the Ring, Saruman had bred the
# Uruk-hai, his own creations of mixed orc and human.

#			and the Morannon.

#		Maraud-hai (alt: Nau-hai) Marauder Tribe
#			Special Uruk culture used for events. Use for characters.
#			Matt note: actually the Nau-hai, but they prefer
#			the Westron word Marauder. Their Mercenary Company
#			the Maraud-hai is a corruption of their name.
#		Kû-hai (alt: Arataus-hai) Outlaw Tribe
