# Remaining Ioriags
#Kykûria - From the heart of the Rhunnic step. Historical forefathers to the Balcoth Empire and Asdriags. Compareable to the Eothed/Rohirrim relation
#Asdriags - Primary driving force of the Balcoth Empire. Together with the Odhriags are also known as the Khundolar based on one of their ancient leaders.
#Odhriags - The Easterlings which have long settled the northern side of the Mountains of Shadow.
#Magriags - Westernmost of the Ioriags, their settlement forms the periphary of the Golden Realm. Also known as the Jangovar.

# Igath Group TO BE IMPLEMENTED - these cultures are Ulgathig speakers, with each culture having their distinct dialect, special mention goes to the Logathig of the Logath, considered to be the ancient lingua franca of Rhun. This culture group is strongly associated with the Wainrider Confederation/Empire (the Igath having the core of it), as well as the lost empire of Szreldor. 

#Igath - the Wainriders
#Sagath - another of the composite clans of the Wainriders, the Sagath are defined more by their ancient allegiance to the house of Hôz/Hûz, which is the last surviving remant of the ancient ruling dynasty of Rhun in the second age, the Szreldor
#Logath - one of the oldest and most well-defined groups in the Rhun, having in ages past been the main trading partners of Dorwinion in particular and the wider northman in general, a fact that has positioned their dialect of Ulghatig, Logathig as the lingua franca of Rhun, though by the rise of the Golden Realm, its prominence has long since diminished. One of the more interesting aspects of the Logath comes in the form of its’ religion, being the sole group that still retains the Matriarchical society, that was once the norm in Rhun in ages past, but that has been influenced by the Dorwinion worship of Entwifes (Turns out being trade partners and a Matriarchical society lends itself to the worship of female deities).
#Ulgath - Those of the Igath who settled the eastern shore of the Sea of Rhun

# Summarizing Note - Ioriags are the second wave of Easterlings, primarily arriving in the third age, aligned with the Balcoth Empire. The Igath are the ancient Easterlings of Rhun, who migrated there in the Second Age. All of them save the Logath are incorporated parts of the Golden Realm at the War of the Ring start.
