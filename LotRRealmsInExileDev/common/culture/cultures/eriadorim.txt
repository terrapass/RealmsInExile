### The Native Population of Arnor ###
## Eriadorim
# The Eriadorim are those akin to the houses of Beor and Hador which remained in Eriador
# choosing to settle the lands east of the Ered Luin. They primarily settled the hills and lands 
# of the later Arthedain and Cardolan, particularly the Weather Hills, Emyn Uial, and the North and South Downs.
# First encountering their Numenorean kin after the return of the Numenoreans in 600 S.A., they maintained 
# friendly relations with them, unlike the Dunlendings to the south, as the Numenoreans recognized their shared kinship.

# In the second age, many of the Eriadorim offered tribute to and recognized the lordship of Gil-galad.
# As the Faithful settled Arnor in the later Second Age, they increasingly intermingled with the
# Eriadorim, and after the Downfall took Elendil for their king, becoming a bedrock of the Kingom of
# Arnor.

## Breelanders
# A group akin to the house of Haleth, the Breelanders adopted the tongue and many 
# of the customs of their Eriadorim neighbors, and as such were recognized as 
# kin by the Numenoreans upon their return. At their heart, they are a simple people.
# They want to be left alone to their simple lives and simple worries.
