# So currently it's a bit weird how modifiers are added.
# First, we need a character + county modifier. Why? The answer is because 
# we're adding a modifier to settlement county based on whether the CHARACTER has a certain modifier.

# So, for example, lets say you have the 'easy_arnor_settle' modifier, then it will apply the 
# 'arnor_settler_influx' to every wilderness county you have.

# Process: 
# 1.) 	Define 2 modifiers, 1 character + 1 county modifier (character one is merely descriptive
# 2.) 	Go to lotr_wastelands_effects.txt, under scripted_effects, and look for the if = {} under ai_colonisation_effect
#		which is where you add the **county modifier**
# 3.) 	Add the character modifier via event or decision.

easy_arnor_settle = { # Aragorn gets this modifier when he destroyes Mordor
	icon = stewardship_positive
}
arnor_settler_influx = { # Wilderness counties get this modifier if being settled by Aragorn, look at ^^^ modifier
	icon = stewardship_positive
	development_growth = 30
}

moderate_increase_wilderness_dev_growth_character = {
	icon = stewardship_positive
}
moderate_increase_wilderness_dev_growth_county = {
	icon = stewardship_positive
	development_growth = 15
