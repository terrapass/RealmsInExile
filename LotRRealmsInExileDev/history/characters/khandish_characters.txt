####### THE EMPIRE OF KHAND #######				
# Lore Note from Vector: MERP has it so that Khand is ruled near continuously throughout its history by Ûvatha/Ôvatha the Ringwraith. This has been changed in Realms in Exile.
# Khand instead follows a cyclical pattern of rise and fall - a powerful High-King rises, unifies Khand, and terrorizes the surrounding land, before it shatters upon his death.
# By the War of the Ring, there will have been 9 such High-Kings, the Khûdriag-Ata. These High-Kings take the name of Ôvatha in honor of the first Khûdriag-Ata
# I personally hold that the Nazgul, while effective weapons, are not very effective rulers after becoming wraiths, inspiring terror in their subjects and retainers alike.
# Only orcs or truly fallen Men can enable their full rule, meaning that even when enthroned, they tend to rule through lieutenants, terrorizing weaker souls to follow them when needed.

# Additionally, its rather boring historically if Khand exists as the same coherent blob in history (and raises obvious questions of why it only assaults Gondor the once).

# Thus, the logic for Khand's history is thus: Much like the orcs under his rule, Sauron permits and even encourages the cyclical rise and fall of the Variags, both internally
# and internationally. Their religion and culture is tuned to war, and the stasis of stable rule or even tributary overlords would dull their primary purpose - to be the 
# terrorizing shock troops of Sauron. This keeps their bloodlust awoken, and their blades sharp. If he ever feels they are falling away, he sends Ûvatha/Ôvatha, believed in Khand
# to have ascended after death as a servant of Tumrakhi, to once more unify or give them purpose, a mix of saint and ancestral father. Only once more does Ôvatha I rule Khand again,
# and that is shortly after the Nazgul and Sauron return in T.A. 1000, and only for so long as to reignite their spirit of war and conquest

### High-Kings of Khand as of the War of the Ring ###
# Ôvatha I - The Nazgul, by birth Ûvatha. First unifier of Khand, the cult of Tumrakhi ascends in his long reign
# Ôvatha II - Descendent of Ôvatha I, ascending the throne after his ancestor is summoned to Mordor, his wraith visage too terrifying for functional rulership. Played off as Tumrakhi ascending him as a champion
# Ôvatha III - Son of Ôvatha II. After his death, the rule of the line of Ôvatha I is broken, and the long tradition of Khandish disunity begins. From his daughters many of the clans claim descend from the unifier
# Ôvatha IV - High-King of Khand at the time of the Last Alliance, born Oldur of Ûbesêsh. He recieved a vision/visit from Ôvatha I, who at the direction of Sauron after the Akallabeth set to rousing the Variags
# Ôvatha V - First unifier of Khand since the Last Alliance, around 1050 T.A. Known for being reclusive yet a terrifying warrior, it is speculated that this may be Ôvatha I returned, his rule is short but reinvigorates the Variags
# Ôvatha VI - 'The Great', born Yursal in the aftermath of the coalition assault upon Gondor, he exploited the much weakened Easterlings and Haradrim and culled Variag elite to rise swiftly, with his reign beginning what is considered one of Khand's golden ages
# Ôvatha VII - 'The Preserver', born Kedezh, grandson of Ovatha VI, who continued the golden age of Khand
# Ôvatha VIII - 'The Defeated', defeated in combat by Bountig of Medloshukain
# Ôvatha IX - Grandfather of Keiseimu of Upper Khand, the last High-King before the WOTR


### Dynasties ###
## Lore Note: Khand's dynasties are transient and generally short-lived. It is rare to find one that remains prominent for more than 5 generations
# House of Ovathanid, Line of Ovatha the Ringwraith
# House of Keiseimu, King of Upper Khand at the War of the Ring
# House of Vangaris, King of Lower Khand at the War of the Ring
# Skakali Dynasty, the Dynasty of Ôvatha VI & VII, which oversaw a golden age of Khandish supremacy
