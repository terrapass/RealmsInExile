### The Realm of Dorwinion ###

### Early History ###
# Settled in the First Age by some of Northmen, the true tale of Dorwinion does not begin to form until the second. During the early second age, some of the Entwives came and made their abode in the 
# lower Celduin, and taught the people there much of agriculture, and Dorwinion became fertile and prosperous. However, this attracted the ire of Sauron, and jealousy of the newly arrived Easterlings.
# The Szreldor, an easterling dynasty, was pushed by Sauron to assault Dorwinion, and indeed conquered it and reigned over it most cruelly for generations, until the Last Alliance, whence the Dorwinrim
# overthrew their oppressors. But in the absence, a new society had been formed, between patriarchical northmen and matriarchical Logath (Easterling) traditions. The Dorwinrim were now a more mixed people,
# though still accounted friends of the West and Northmen as a whole. Since those days, Dorwinion has endured, though internally its power has drifted back and forth between the Great Merchants and the Wine Lords.
# The Great Merchants are those who emphasize long-range trade of manufactured goods - connections with Gondor, the Far East, and Eriador were their priority. In comparison, the Wine-lords are the traditional
# aristocrats, though more by dint of their large estates than any true cultural practice of nobility. They prioritized agriculture and more local trade.

### RECENT HISTORY ###
# Dorwinion, under the sway of the Great Merchants at the time, submitted to the Balchoth in exchange for autonomy and right not to fight in their wars. The Balchoth empire's re-opening of the East-west routes,
# long constrained after the Wainrider empire and its collapse, thus saw massive trade booms for Dorwinion. When it finally fell, the chaos wreaked havoc on the Great Merchants, and the Wine-lords gained the ascendancy,
# with many of the Great Merchants folded into the old landed families. Since then, Dorwinion has stabilized, as the empowered aristocracy threw themselves behind Realm-master Bladorthin's reforms to strengthen and centralize the
# state, increasing the ability of the state. However, some of the remaining Great Merchants and even the Wine-lords feel that the Realm-masters have begun to overstep their traditional bounds of authority, no longer needing to
# consult the local elites on major decisions of war and peace. However, the Realm-master is still much more constrained in his actions than any peer king.

### Politics of Dorwinion###
# Traditionally, Dorwinion is ruled by a 'realm-master', an elected office from the major cities and leaders. However, since the fall of the Balchoth, the ancient Winelords of the House of Koldana have fairly consistently 
# won the election to the office (though not always), and abroad many have even been called the 'Kings' of Dorwinion. Bladorthin the Great is an example of a member of this dynasty, as is his descendant Hawin Koldana, the realm-master at our start.

# Political machinations and intrigue are an important part of Dorwinion society and politics - whether in trade or politics, the ability to speak well, make connections, and leverage them is paramount in daily life.
# Warfare is generally fought by mercenaries, as the cities and Realm-master can only raise large-scale levies with a vote from an assembly of delegates, but the right of taxation and hiring of mercenaries for either the entire realm
# or the large internal cities can be done without such need. The Realm-master is empowered to keep a large number of Men-at-arms in the capital and throughout the realm to maintain peace and security. 
# Dorwinion coin can be found far throughout Rhun, with their mercenaries used as proxies against this or that rival, against the Easterlings to sow division and instability, and many a coup and assassination has been carried with Dorwinion backing.

# Bladorthin the Great, of the House of Koldana
# Born in T.A. 2716, elected to the position of Realm-master in 2758, Bladorthin pursued a policy of strengthening the office of Realm-master and pursuing relations with the Northmen realms up the river Celduin and the Elves and Dwarves.
# As an example of this, he commissioned arms for the elite soldiery that Dorwinion maintained from the Dwarves of Erebor, though these weapons were never delivered due to the coming of Smaug. 
# Many speculate his efforts to strengthen the power of Dorwinion and office of Realm-master were driven by his wary watch of his contemporary, Bountig the Great of Medlóshûkain. 
# Dorwinion (or perhaps more specifically, the Winelords) had prospered in the Easterling Years of Blood, as they could manipulate and play the fractured Easterling polities against one another, and Bladorthin feared a unified Easterling realm - such as the Szreldor, Wainride Empire, or Balchoths - could once more subjugate his people.
# Though he did not live to see the day when Medlóshûkain did become a threat, his descendants and supporters credit his preparatory work as a reason behind the current wary detente between the two realms.
# Bladorthin died in T.A. 2806
