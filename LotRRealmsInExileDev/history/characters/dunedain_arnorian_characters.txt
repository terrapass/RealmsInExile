### House Caladir ###
#####################
# Greatest of the houses of Cardolan, House Caladir was established in 2335 by Calatar, a minor noble of Andustar. Falling in love with a local Eriadorim woman 
# in his time in the colonies, he wed her and return to Numenor, but was met with scorn and was basically blocked from the court, derided for his lowly marriage.
# Smarting, Calatar decided to return to the colonies in the future lands of Cardolan. Using his wife's local connections and his own considerable wealth, he 
# built a palatial complex in Argond, and swiftly established himself as the pre-eminent colonial lord of the region which would one day bear his houses name,
# Dol Caladir. 
#
# In time house Caladir became a kingmaker in colonial and then Arnorian politics, their allegiance vital to the control of Cardolan. King Valandil of Arnor's queen, 
# Findulas, came from house Caladir, and the line would become the Princes of Cardolan after the death of King Tarantor of Cardolan.
