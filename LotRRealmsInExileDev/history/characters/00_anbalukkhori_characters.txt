### Anbalûkkhôri ###
# The Black Numenoreans of An-Balkûmagân, once known as Ciryatore

### In order: 							
# House of Anbalûkkhôrôhîn, line of the Kings and Viceroys of An-Balkûmagân
# House of Sakaltud, line of Nôlôndur (cadet branch of the Anbalûkkhôrôhîn)
# House of Zimrathôn, Ambassadors and Councilors of the Storm-Kingdom (cadet branch of the Anbalûkkhôrôhîn)
# House of Dâirukhôr, generals of the Thôn an-Khârlôkh - The Army of the Southern Dragon #Dulgu the Black, renegade son of Dâirukhôr of Dûshera
# Line of Azrubên of Rómenna, Numenorean governer of An-Balkûmagân, forefather of the kings of the same region

# Internal History: An-Balkûmagân established its own kinship and line of tradition after the downfall of Numenor.
# The returned Storm-King in the 1600s brought An-Balkûmagân and its kings back under his sway during the years of the Thôn an-Khârlôkh, but in the end
# they returned south, not willing to expend their energy and men for a war that had only resulted in the loss of their king. Several hundred years later, the 
# rump realm of the Southern Dragon, with Akhôrahil at its helm, emerged from the hills and marched into the heartland of An-Balkûmagân, reclaiming his throne. 
# Since then the kings in An-Balkûmagân have retained their place, but their crown is now second to their duties as the Alqa of the reborn Thôn an-Khârlôkh.
# They have served faithfully since then, unwilling to risk extermination at the hands of the eternal Storm-King's wrath. He outlasted Numenor who ousted him, after all.
