### The Kingdom of Dale ###

# First settled during the days of the heights of the Kingdom of Rhovanion, the lands of Celduin and Long-Lake formed the northern boundary of Northmen settlement. 
# After the Wainrider invasion, many rallied to the north-lands, hoping to build anew and in time free their kin. In the Mountain's shadow, Aivadiuria gathered many of the remnants of the Free Men of the North beneath his banner, but Dale was not yet born. 
# In history, he is acknowledged as the founder of Dale's royal line, and beneath his (and his heirs) steely leadership, the Northmen dwelled free from the Wainrider's yoke, and held the Celduin until Earnil II defeated them utterly. 
# Upon the coming of Thrór to Erebor, the dispersed Northmen of the region moved to build a town at the roots of the Mountain, to facilitate trade with the wealthy Dwarf-Kingdom. The Lordship of Dale is born, and Aivadiuria's heirs become its lords. 
# Upon its re-establishment by Bard the Bowmen the Kingdom of Dale is born, and under his house and those that followed him, the Northmen grew once more valiant and mighty, growing to dominate all the way to Carduin and across Celduin. 
# As the Fourth Age dawned, Bard II sent emissaries unto Elessar, and there was ever after friendship between the Men of the North and the Men of the West, until the world grew old and the days of yore were forgotten.

# Aivadiuria, T.A. 1832-1901. First Lord of the Dale-Lands (though Dale was not yet founded) and Bastion of the North. It is by his son that the line of Vidugavia came to intermingle with the future lords of Dale.
