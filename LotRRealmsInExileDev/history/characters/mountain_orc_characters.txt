### History ###

### Secound Age ###
# Skorg conquers Gundabad and his direct line holds it up the war of the last alliance. After that Durin V reconquer Gundabad and Skorgs linage splits apart to smaller houses. 

### Third age ###
# The spawn(Urro, Aarlok & Orkarmur) of Grimtok, the last ruler of Gundabad before Dwarves retook it, escapes and survive the loss of Gundabad and form might factions from the survivng orc forces of Gundabad.
# Urro forms the "Lokikrah-kai" (Dragon claw) and his "factions" rebuilds it strengh somewhere around the mountains of withering heath, they retake gundabad sometime around 350 T.A. 
# Aarlok form's a dynasty that spreads Skorgs blood in forodwaith, while Orkarmur does the same but joins up and forms Uruk-Ongmair (orcs of Angmar) later on
# the Lokikrah-kai builds a power base in the grey mountains where they convert to "dragon cult" and then around 350-450 t.a. attacks and retakes gundabad
# 
# 1267 T.A. A  Balcog emerges in the Ered Mithrin(for now). Wishing to restore the cult of Ulûkai he'd amassed a great number of orcish warriors (and supported by the Nazgûl-lord on his quest to found the realm of Angmar) he attacks Mount Gundabad in force during the summer but is unable to take it immediately

### Worauthai Madur ###
# The Northerners or Free Tribes of the North

### In order:
# Line of Skorg, the first decendents of Skrog. While the other dynasties would also identiyfy and claim to be of his decendence this is the first line before them splitting
# Line of Urro, Grimtok's spawn. after the war of the las alliance Grimtok lose gundabad to Durin V and his heirs split and form new houses. Urro's line goes to thw withered heath. [made-up by Rémerod]
# Line of Aarlok, Grimtok's spawn. after the war of the las alliance Grimtok lose gundabad to Durin V and his heirs split and form new houses. Aarlok escapes to forofwaith [made-up by Rémerod]
# Line of Orkarmur, Grimtok's spawn. after the war of the las alliance Grimtok lose gundabad to Durin V and his heirs split and form new houses. Orkarmur escapes to forofwaith and later are one of the ones that forms Uruk-Ongmair [made-up by Rémerod]
