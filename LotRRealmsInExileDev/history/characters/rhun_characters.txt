### The Inland Sea of Rhun ###

### HISTORY ###
# Vector to add more fully at a later date (currently in his head)

### Second Age ###
# Empire of Szreldor

### Third Age ###
# Wainrider Confederacy - circa T.A. 1850-1900
# Balchoth Empire - circa T.A. 2400-2510
# Balchoth Collapse - the three successor states of Rostamush, Narimanush, and Bozorganush emerge - 2510-2515/30 (depending on empire in question)
# The Successor States Collapse/The Years of Blood Begin - 2530-2770
# The Golden Realm rises - 2766, Bountig Medlókan returns from his travels abroad and begins to order the Golden Realm. Many old houses fall in the unification wars

### Cultures of Rhun ###
# The Igath - the older group (though the Ioriags have also dwelled in the region since the early second age). Trained their women in martial for defense of the home. Were the dominant cultures of the Wainrider Confederacy. See culture file for more
# The Ioriags - the newer group to move into Rhun. The Asdriags are the last of these to have arrived in the late third age, and formed the Balchoth Empire.

### Historic Dynasties TO BE ADDED ###
# dynasty_szrel - the ruling dynasty of Szreldor. The house of Huz is a cadet branch of this.
# dynasty_pultai - the ruling dynasty of the Balchoth. The lords of Mistrand at our start are the last surviving cadet branch of them, though they've long abandoned their Ioriag heritage for their Igathic subjects
# dynasty_zhamik - the house of Zhamik the Zealous, the Loke-kan at our start. Not very old.
# dynasty_rostamush - the dynasty of the successor empire of Rostamush, now widdled down to a single line on the fringes of the Golden Realm. Their heir has entered the survice of Dol Guldur in the hope of being rewarded with the viceroyalty of Dale
# dynasty_narimanush - the Odhriag dynasty which ruled the successor empire of Narimanush, who has either abandoned or forgotten their former height. Only related to the emperor of Narimanush through the female line - a weak claim.
# dynasty_bozorganush - the Ulgath dynasty of Bozorganush, their current head Rurzaur is one of the most powerful vassals of the Golden Realm, ruling the eastern shore of the Sea of Rhun from his house's ancestral seat.
