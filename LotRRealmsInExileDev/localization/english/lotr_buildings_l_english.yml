The Guild of Venturers found the islands uninhabited and with poor harborage for large vessels, and they were little-settled by colonists save for the main islands of Kirithâni and Tol Avrâdi. \n\nAfter the Downfall they were largely disregarded by the cities of Bellakar, allowing them to be overrun by the Corsairs, who used them as a base for raiding traffic along the coasts of Harad. Even now, the unmapped coves and caves are used by smugglers to store their ill-gotten gains, and a tithe of this illicit wealth finds its way into the hands of the Lord of the Lonely Isles."

Yet the great Arch remained unscathed, now somewhat inland, and the survivors incorporated it into the new city walls as the main landward portal into the city.

All this was brought to ruin by the earthquakes that accompanied the Downfall. \n\nÛrêzâyaneth was restored in reduced form, it's stonework raised by craftsmen of lesser skill. And though the Adûnâim remained prideful, as a sign of their submission to Manwë and in memory of their drowned homeland they raised a great marble pillar overlooking the sea. This was surmounted by an eagle facing West, cast from whitegold recovered from the ruins of the old city. Even now the pillar remains, a source of great pride to the Faithful of Bellekar."

Over the centuries, in the waxing and waning of An-Balkumagan’s power, it has often fallen into the hands of the rebellious natives of Tulwang, or been captured by foreign powers seeking to check Anbalûkkhôri expansion. Yet it remains a place of fear, casting a chill shadow across the bay of Tulwang."

An ingenious network of concealed platforms linked by artful sky-bridges and rope walkways are held aloft by a combination of ingenious carpentry and the ancient trees of the forest itself, such that some Sairthiuda are said to never touch the ground, and to fear it. \n\nA source of enormous pride for the woodmen, and regarded as a deeply sacred place, Sairthiudabaurg is also difficult for any enemy to attack due to its skillful concealment and the constant threat of arrows and other projectiles raining down from above; many a raiding party has been slaughtered in the space of a breath without even realising that their futile march had reached the sky-city of the Sairthiuda."
