 game_concept_colonisation_desc:0 "Colonisation is a game mechanic that allows an [independent_ruler|E] to expand their [realm|E] into neighboring [wilderness|E] [counties|E].\n\nAfter an initial investment of [gold|E], a [settlement_holding|E] can be established, bringing the [county|E] into their [domain|E]. Initially, this settlement will be unproductive and it will be unable to build standard [buildings|E] in the [holding|E]. Instead, time and [gold|E] must be invested to increase [development|E] in the new settlement and clear any [colonisation_blockers|E] that exist.\n\nOnce all blockers have been cleared, the [settlement_holding|E] is fully upgraded, and the colony has reached a [county_development|E] of 3 or greater, the Settlement can be converted into a standard [holding|E]."
