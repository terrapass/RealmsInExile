We lost our way once or twice, the old maps not accounting for rockslides and other shifts in terrain, but nothing we could not handle.\n\nA humble but hearty fire has already begun to blaze in the center of the camp, tents rising up. It will be good to not have to move them again soon. As the last of the tents are erected, stakes digging deep into the rocky ground, the expedition members begin to gather around, a low hum of chatter filling the air.\n\nQuickly finding a sturdy box, I get atop it. A quick sharp whistle pierces the air, and swiftly the expedition members quiet down and give me their attention. Here we are at the precipice of the real work, and how I speak may well set the mood of the rest of the expedition. All eyes are on me, awaiting instruction. After taking a fortifying breath, I begin to speak."

 mining.8001.desc.mithril:0 "In the dimly lit cavern, a wondrous sight beholds us. With torchlight flickering upon the walls, we venture deeper into the heart of the earth. There, amidst the ancient stones and shadows, we find it – Mithril! Its shimmering surface, akin to moonlight caught in solid form, adorns the walls like the armor of the Valar themselves. A metal of such rare beauty and strength that all can scarce believe their eyes."
 mining.8001.desc.gold:0 "As we toil beneath the rocky embrace of the mountains, the earth yields up one of its most coveted treasures – Gold! Gleaming like the first rays of dawn upon a still lake, the veins of this lustrous metal dance through the dark stone like a hidden river of wealth. With each strike of the pickaxe, we unearth more of this gilded bounty, and our hearts sing with the promise of riches untold."

 mining.8003.desc.5:0 "As I stand amidst the resplendent chambers of the mines, my heart swells with jubilation, for my mining expedition has proved to be a resounding triumph, exceeding my loftiest expectations. The depths of this ancient realm have yielded a veritable treasure trove of material, their brilliance rivaled only by the gleam in my miners' eyes.\n\nThe riches flowing forth from these great caverns have more than compensated for the expenses incurred, filling my coffers to overflowing. This venture shall be recounted as a shining testament to the fortune that smiles upon the venturesome, and my house shall bask in the glow of unparalleled success."
 mining.8003.t.3:0 "A Healthy Bounty"
 mining.8003.desc.3:0 "Amidst the echoing expanse of the sprawling mines, I find myself in a state of measured satisfaction as I appraise the results of my mining expedition. While not an overwhelming success, our efforts have borne fruit, yielding a respectable cache of material. The costs incurred in the venture have been covered, with a modest surplus to my name.\n\nIt is a satisfactory outcome, though not one that will have bards composing epic ballads in our honor. In the depths of the earth, where fortune is often as capricious as the shifting shadows, I have found a measure of prosperity."
 mining.8003.t.1:0 "A Modest Success"
 mining.8003.desc.1:0 "In the shadowed recesses of the cavernous mines, I stand with a hint of resignation as I survey the outcome of my mining expedition. Though not a complete disappointment, our endeavors have yielded only a modest amount of material.\n\nThe meager returns barely cover the expenses incurred in my venture, leaving little to celebrate. In the labyrinthine depths of these ancient caverns, fortune has proven elusive, and my gains remain but a faint glimmer in the dark."

 mining.8004.t.5:0 "Total Failure"
 mining.8004.desc.5:0 "As the last of my team wearily steps out of the mine, I look upon the paltry haul of my ill-fated expedition. A heavy heart weighs upon me, for this venture has proven naught but a dire folly. Those echoing chambers yielded not the treasures I sought, but instead swallowed my fortune and ambition whole.\n\nOur pickaxes, once wielded with hopeful vigor, have grown heavy with futility, as the riches we had dreamed of remain locked in the unyielding grasp of the earth. The coffers of my house, now bereft of wealth, mockingly reflect the dimming embers of my once-proud dreams, and I, the noble leader, must bear the weight of our costly misadventure."
 mining.8004.t.3:0 "A Lackluster Yield"
 mining.8004.desc.3:0 "As I stand amidst the dimly lit tunnels of the mines, a heavy sigh escapes my lips, and my brow furrows in disappointment. My mining expedition, while not an unmitigated disaster, has proven to be a middling endeavor at best. The riches that we had hoped to uncover were scarce, and the costs incurred in setting up our operations far exceeded the modest gains.\n\nMy coffers are not entirely emptied, but they are far from brimming with the riches I had envisioned. It is a somber reckoning, a reminder that the whims of fate do not always favor the venturesome."
 mining.8004.t.1:0 "A Mild Disappointment"
 mining.8004.desc.1:0 "Amidst the echoing chambers of the mines, I find myself grappling with a sense of mild vexation as I assess the outcome of my mining expedition. While not an unequivocal triumph, it would be an exaggeration to label it a failure of great magnitude. My miners, with their unwavering determination, did manage to unearth some modest caches, enough to recoup a portion of my investment, though not as abundant as my initial hopes had suggested.\n\nThe cost of the expedition remains a burden, yet it is one I can bear without grave consequences. In this venture, I have learned that the depths of the earth are as capricious as they are mysterious, sometimes yielding treasures in moderation."
 mining.8004.a:0 "Let's finish packing and head home."
