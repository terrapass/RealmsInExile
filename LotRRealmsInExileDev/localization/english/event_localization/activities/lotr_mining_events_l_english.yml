 mining.8001.desc.peridot:0 "In a hidden alcove, we stumble upon Peridots, gems of fresh green like the first leaves of spring. Their vibrant color speaks of renewal and hope, a welcome sight in the depths of the earth. Peridots, stones of optimism and growth, will bring a sense of life to our craftsmanship."
 mining.8001.desc.quartz:0 "In the crystalline heart of the caverns, we find Quartz, its clear and transparent beauty like the purest waters of the Anduin. Its clarity hints at truth and insight, and we know that this Quartz will become prized for its ability to reveal the hidden secrets of the world."
 mining.8001.desc.unknown:0 "In a deep secluded chamber we find many beautiful gems and treasures, a great relief as we approach the end of my expedition."

 mining.8001.a:0 "Great success!"

 mining.8002.t:0 "Empty Handed"
 mining.8002.desc:0 "The end of my expedition approaches, and my prospecting efforts have yielded nothing more than a few shallow veins and false hope. There is an air of disappointment in camp as my team begins to pack up our equipment for the journey home."
 mining.8002.a:0 "There's always next time..."

 mining.8003.t.5:0 "Resplendent Riches"
 mining.8003.desc.5:0 "As I stand amidst the resplendent chambers of the mines, my heart swells with jubilation, for my mining expedition has proved to be a resounding triumph, exceeding my loftiest expectations. The depths of this ancient realm have yielded a veritable treasure trove of material, their brilliance rivaled only by the gleam in my miners' eyes.\n\nThe riches flowing forth from these great caverns have more than compensated for the expenses incurred, filling my coffers to overflowing. This venture shall be recounted as a shining testament to the fortune that smiles upon the venturesome, and my house shall bask in the glow of unparalleled success."
 mining.8003.t.3:0 "A Healthy Bounty"
 mining.8003.desc.3:0 "Amidst the echoing expanse of the sprawling mines, I find myself in a state of measured satisfaction as I appraise the results of my mining expedition. While not an overwhelming success, our efforts have borne fruit, yielding a respectable cache of material. The costs incurred in the venture have been covered, with a modest surplus to my name.\n\nIt is a satisfactory outcome, though not one that will have bards composing epic ballads in our honor. In the depths of the earth, where fortune is often as capricious as the shifting shadows, I have found a measure of prosperity."
 mining.8003.t.1:0 "A Modest Success"
 mining.8003.desc.1:0 "In the shadowed recesses of the cavernous mines, I stand with a hint of resignation as I survey the outcome of my mining expedition. Though not a complete disappointment, our endeavors have yielded only a modest amount of material.\n\nThe meager returns barely cover the expenses incurred in my venture, leaving little to celebrate. In the labyrinthine depths of these ancient caverns, fortune has proven elusive, and my gains remain but a faint glimmer in the dark."
 mining.8003.a:0 "Let's finish packing and head home!"

 mining.8004.t.5:0 "Total Failure"
 mining.8004.desc.5:0 "As the last of my team wearily steps out of the mine, I look upon the paltry haul of my ill-fated expedition. A heavy heart weighs upon me, for this venture has proven naught but a dire folly. Those echoing chambers yielded not the treasures I sought, but instead swallowed my fortune and ambition whole.\n\nOur pickaxes, once wielded with hopeful vigor, have grown heavy with futility, as the riches we had dreamed of remain locked in the unyielding grasp of the earth. The coffers of my house, now bereft of wealth, mockingly reflect the dimming embers of my once-proud dreams, and I, the noble leader, must bear the weight of our costly misadventure."
 mining.8004.t.3:0 "A Lackluster Yield"
 mining.8004.desc.3:0 "As I stand amidst the dimly lit tunnels of the mines, a heavy sigh escapes my lips, and my brow furrows in disappointment. My mining expedition, while not an unmitigated disaster, has proven to be a middling endeavor at best. The riches that we had hoped to uncover were scarce, and the costs incurred in setting up our operations far exceeded the modest gains.\n\nMy coffers are not entirely emptied, but they are far from brimming with the riches I had envisioned. It is a somber reckoning, a reminder that the whims of fate do not always favor the venturesome."
 mining.8004.t.1:0 "A Mild Disappointment"
 mining.8004.desc.1:0 "Amidst the echoing chambers of the mines, I find myself grappling with a sense of mild vexation as I assess the outcome of my mining expedition. While not an unequivocal triumph, it would be an exaggeration to label it a failure of great magnitude. My miners, with their unwavering determination, did manage to unearth some modest caches, enough to recoup a portion of my investment, though not as abundant as my initial hopes had suggested.\n\nThe cost of the expedition remains a burden, yet it is one I can bear without grave consequences. In this venture, I have learned that the depths of the earth are as capricious as they are mysterious, sometimes yielding treasures in moderation."
 mining.8004.a:0 "Let's finish packing and head home."
