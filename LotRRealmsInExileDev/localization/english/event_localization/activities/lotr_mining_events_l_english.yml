 mining.0200.t:1 "An Air of Expectation"
 mining.0200.desc:1 "It has been a long and arduous journey, but we have finally made it. We lost our way once or twice, the old maps not accounting for rockslides and other shifts in terrain, but nothing we could not handle.\n\nA humble but hearty fire has already begun to blaze in the center of the camp, tents rising up. It will be good to not have to move them again soon. As the last of the tents are erected, stakes digging deep into the rocky ground, the expedition members begin to gather around, a low hum of chatter filling the air.\n\nQuickly finding a sturdy box, I get atop it. A quick sharp whistle pierces the air, and swiftly the expedition members quiet down and give me their attention. Here we are at the precipice of the real work, and how I speak may well set the mood of the rest of the expedition. All eyes are on me, awaiting instruction. After taking a fortifying breath, I begin to speak."
