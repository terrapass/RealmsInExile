 # The Awakening of the Elves

 explore_history.1001.t:0 "The Awakening of the Elves"
 explore_history.1001.desc:0 "On the far eastern shores of the lost Inland Sea of Helcar, in a bay that came to be known as Cuiviénen, the first Elves awoke from the sleep of Ilúvatar. Here they dwelt for a time, happy under the beauty of the stars in heaven and have ever since loved starlight and revered their creator Varda above all the Valar.\n\nBefore long, the fledgling elves were discovered by Melkor, who sent his dark agents to watch from the shadows and capture any elf that strayed too far from the Waters of Awakening. These unfortunate souls were imprisoned in the bowels of Utumno and, through slow arts of cruelty were corrupted and bred to form the Orcs in envy and mockery of the Elves.\n\nLater, the Elves were found by the Valar Oromë in his hunts upon Middle Earth, and he was seized with a desire to protect them. And so it came to pass that the Powers made war upon Melkor to deliver the Elves from the clutches of evil, forever changing the face of Middle-Earth in the conflict and imprisoning Melkor in the Halls of Mandos for thousands of years."
 explore_history.1001.a:0 "Thank Eru for the protection of the Valar against such terrifying evil!"
 explore_history.1001.b:0 "It is right that Melkor was judged for his ill-deeds."
 explore_history.1001.c:0 "Melkor created his own race by capturing and corrupting the Elves? Intriguing..."

 explore_history.1002.t:0 "The Avari"
 explore_history.1002.desc:0 "With Morgoth humbled and in chains, Oromë came again to the Elves, and passionately called them to follow him to Valinor, promising them safety, tutelage, and light. The Elves sent three ambassadors from among them to travel to Valinor and speak for their people: Ingwë, Finwë, and Elwë.\n\nReturning from Valinor, they were so filled with awe by the glory and majesty of the Valar and the splendour of the light of the Trees that they urged their people to heed the summons of the Valar and make the long journey west to Valinor.\n\nThus befell the First Sundering of the Elves. For while the kindred of Ingwë and some of the kindreds of Finwë and Elwë were willing to follow Oromë, there were many still that refused the call to leave the lands of their birth, as they loved Middle-Earth and the starlight above the unknown West and rumours of its burning light. These Elves became known as the Avari, the Unwilling, and would not meet their kindred again until many ages were past."
 explore_history.1002.a:0 "A tragic parting, but the Eldar were right to journey West."
 explore_history.1002.b:0 "After seeing nothing but wrath and deception from the Ainur, who can blame the Avari?"

 explore_history.1003.t:0 "The Vanyar"
 explore_history.1003.desc:0 "Once the Elves who answered the summons of the Valar set out on the Great Journey, they were further split into three groups. The smallest of these groups was led by Ingwë and were the most anxious to reach Valinor.\n\nThe Vanyar led the way, pushing ever westward at a great pace, becoming the first to reach the shores of the vast Belegaer Sea. It was here that the Valar Ulmo uprooted the large island known as Tol Eressëa from the middle of the ocean and, with the help of his servants, used it to ferry the Vanyar from the shore and across the waves to the land of Valinor. For his haste and his zeal, Ingwë was crowned High-King of all the Elves.\n\nThe Vanyar loved the Valar and the light of Valinor above all else, choosing never to return to Middle-Earth, save to fight in the War of Wrath in the final overthrow of Melkor at the end of the First Age."
 explore_history.1003.a:0 "Such devotion and unwavering dedication to a single cause is inspiring."
 explore_history.1003.b:0 "Who can blame them? I'd have been on the first boat to Valinor too!"
 explore_history.1003.c:0 "High-King of all the Elves! Sounds like a lot of work..."

 explore_history.1004.t:0 "The Ñoldor"
 explore_history.1004.desc:0 "The next to arrive were the Elves known as the Ñoldor, led by Finwë, making good time but not bearing the same burning determination of the Vanyar. When they arrived in Valinor they built the city of Tirion upon the green hill of Túna with the help of the Vanyar in the gap of the Pelóri Mountains, and it was here that Finwë ruled over his people.\n\nThe Ñoldor are accounted as the most skilled among all the Elves in lore and smithing, the greatest among them being Finwë's son Fëanor, creator of the famed Silmarils. Many Ñoldor would eventually return to Middle-Earth to fight against Melkor and form the most well known of the great Elven kingdoms."
 explore_history.1004.a:0 "The Ñoldor mastery of craftsmanship is amazing, they have the blessing of Aulë!"
 explore_history.1004.b:0 "Those gems caused more trouble than they were worth... what folly!"

 explore_history.1005.t:0 "The Teleri"
 explore_history.1005.desc:0 "Finally came the Elves known as the Teleri led by the brothers Olwë and Elwë and largest of the three kindreds who set out on the Great Journey. Unlike their Vanyar and Ñoldor brethren, the Teleri were a diverse group with great portions of their disunited host settling along the way without ever making it to Valinor.\n\nIn the woods of Rhovanion the Silvan and Nandor settled while the Green-Elves settled the forests of Ossiriand and the Ered Luin. The Sindar made their home in Doriath after tarrying there to try to find their leader Elwë, who had become enraptured with the Maia Melian. Last were the Falathrim who settled the coasts of Beleriand, taking Nowë (in later years known as Círdan) as their lord.\n\nFinally, those remaining few that completed the Great Journey to Valinor under the leadership of Olwë founded the city of Alqualondë, the Haven of the Swans, and became known as the Falmari."
 explore_history.1005.a:0 "A lesson in perseverance, and the rewards of seeing things through to the end."
 explore_history.1005.b:0 "Why rush to Valinor when there is so much wonder in Middle-Earth!"
 explore_history.1005.c:0 "These Teleri must have been harder to herd than cats! And how can you just... lose a king?"
