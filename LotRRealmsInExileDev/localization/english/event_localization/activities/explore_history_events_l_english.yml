 explore_history.0001.desc:0 "As the sun rises above the horizon, I stretch and make my way to the library. Pouring over the dusty tomes, I know I could never read them all in my lifetime. The histories of Middle Earth run deep into the distant past, with all manner of tales since time immemorial.\n\nWith so much to explore, I must focus my efforts on the era which interests me most."

 explore_history.0010.desc:0 "The Years of the Trees, also called the Days of Bliss or the Noontide of Valinor, were the long years that lay between the founding of Valinor and its darkening. During this time, Valinor was lit by the light of the Two Trees while Middle-earth lay in the Great Darkness.\n\nIt was in this age that the Elves awoke and the Valar waged the Battle of the Powers, the dark fortress of Utumno was destroyed, and Melkor was chained within the Halls of Mandos for three ages of the world. The elves of Valinor grew in skill and power, before Melkor spread lies and discord amongst them before the ultimate destruction of the Two Trees.\n\nYour scholars apologise for the small amount of literature available for this distant age. Perhaps in time, they will be able to uncover more."

 explore_history.0020.desc:0 "The First Age describes the events near the beginning of time. Also known as the Elder Days, the First Age saw the creation of the races of Arda, their flourishing in Valinor and Beleriand, their feats against Melkor and his eventual overthrow by the combined armies of Valar, Elves and Edain.\n\nThe first age saw some of Middle-earth's greatest triumphs and tragedies, and it ended when the Valar cast Melkor beyond the Gates of Night, banishing him into the timeless Void."

 explore_history.0030.desc:0 "Beginning in the 584th year after the Return of the Ñoldor to Middle-earth, the Second Age is the longest of the chronicled Ages. Beginning after the destruction of Beleriand in the War of Wrath, it saw the founding of Lindon and the creation of Númenor: the two major Elvish and Mannish kingdoms of the Age.\n\nIn this age were the Rings of Power forged, which would set the stage for the events of the later Second and the entirety of the Third Age. At this time the Númenóreans achieved the apex of their power and splendour before the world was remade and Númenor cast down in the Akallabeth. 3441 years after it began, the Second Age ended with the defeat of Sauron in the War of the Last Alliance.\n\nThe scholars sharing the room with you complain that several of the old tomes are currently on loan and hope they shall be returned soon.

In the meantime, the Elves and Dwarves and other peoples have done little new; also known as the Fading Years, this age has marked a slow waning of the Elves.\n\nThe scribes apologise that the selection of texts is currently so unexpectedly small.

 # The Sundering of the Elves

 explore_history.1001.t:0 "The Awakening of the Elves"
 explore_history.1001.desc:0 "On the far eastern shores of the lost Inland Sea of Helcar, in a bay that came to be known as Cuiviénen, the first Elves awoke from the sleep of Ilúvatar. Here they dwelt for a time, happy under the beauty of the stars in heaven and have ever since loved starlight and revered their creator Varda above all the Valar.\n\nBefore long, the fledgling elves were discovered by Melkor, who sent his dark agents to watch from the shadows and capture any elf that strayed too far from the Waters of Awakening. These unfortunate souls were imprisoned in the bowels of Utumno and, through slow arts of cruelty were corrupted and bred to form the Orcs in envy and mockery of the Elves.\n\nLater, the Elves were found by the Valar Oromë in his hunts upon Middle Earth, and he was seized with a desire to protect them. And so, it came to pass that the Powers made war upon Melkor to deliver the Elves from the clutches of evil, forever changing the face of Middle-Earth in the conflict and imprisoning Melkor in the Halls of Mandos for thousands of years."
 explore_history.1001.a:0 "Thank Eru for the protection of the Valar against such terrifying evil!"
 explore_history.1001.b:0 "It is right that Melkor was judged for his ill-deeds."
 explore_history.1001.c:0 "Melkor created his own race by capturing and corrupting the Elves? Intriguing..."

 explore_history.1002.t:0 "The Avari"
 explore_history.1002.desc:0 "With Morgoth humbled and in chains, Oromë came again to the Elves, and passionately called them to follow him to Valinor, promising them safety, tutelage, and light. The Elves sent three ambassadors from among them to travel to Valinor and speak for their people: Ingwë, Finwë, and Elwë.\n\nReturning from Valinor, they were so filled with awe by the glory and majesty of the Valar and the splendour of the light of the Trees that they urged their people to heed the summons of the Valar and make the long journey west to Valinor.\n\nThus, befell the First Sundering of the Elves. For while the kindred of Ingwë and some of the kindreds of Finwë and Elwë were willing to follow Oromë, there were many still that refused the call to leave the lands of their birth, as they loved Middle-Earth and the starlight above the unknown West and rumours of its burning light. These Elves became known as the Avari, the Unwilling, and would not meet their kindred again until many ages were past."
 explore_history.1002.a:0 "A tragic parting, but the Eldar were right to journey West."
 explore_history.1002.b:0 "After seeing nothing but wrath and deception from the Ainur, who can blame the Avari?"

 explore_history.1003.t:0 "The Vanyar"
 explore_history.1003.desc:0 "Once the Elves who answered the summons of the Valar set out on the Great Journey, they were further split into three groups. The smallest of these groups was led by Ingwë and were the most anxious to reach Valinor.\n\nThe Vanyar led the way, pushing ever westward at a great pace, becoming the first to reach the shores of the vast Belegaer Sea. It was here that the Valar Ulmo uprooted the large island known as Tol Eressëa from the middle of the ocean and, with the help of his servants, used it to ferry the Vanyar from the shore and across the waves to the land of Valinor. For his haste and his zeal, Ingwë was crowned High-King of all the Elves.\n\nThe Vanyar loved the Valar and the light of Valinor above all else, choosing never to return to Middle-Earth, save to fight in the War of Wrath in the final overthrow of Melkor at the end of the First Age."
 explore_history.1003.a:0 "Such devotion and unwavering dedication to a single cause is inspiring."
 explore_history.1003.b:0 "Who can blame them? I'd have been on the first boat to Valinor too!"
 explore_history.1003.c:0 "High-King of all the Elves! Sounds like a lot of work..."

 explore_history.1004.t:0 "The Ñoldor"
 explore_history.1004.desc:0 "The next to arrive were the Elves known as the Ñoldor, led by Finwë, making good time but not bearing the same burning determination of the Vanyar. When they arrived in Valinor they built the city of Tirion upon the green hill of Túna with the help of the Vanyar in the gap of the Pelóri Mountains, and it was here that Finwë ruled over his people.\n\nThe Ñoldor are accounted as the most skilled among all the Elves in lore and smithing, the greatest among them being Finwë's son Fëanor, creator of the famed Silmarils. Many Ñoldor would eventually return to Middle-Earth to fight against Melkor and form the most well-known of the great Elven kingdoms."
 explore_history.1004.a:0 "The Ñoldor's mastery of craftsmanship is amazing, they have Aulë's blessing!"
 explore_history.1004.b:0 "Those gems caused more trouble than they were worth... what folly!"

 explore_history.1005.t:0 "The Teleri"
 explore_history.1005.desc:0 "Finally came the Elves known as the Teleri led by the brothers Olwë and Elwë and largest of the three kindreds who set out on the Great Journey. Unlike their Vanyar and Ñoldor brethren, the Teleri were a diverse group with great portions of their disunited host settling along the way without ever making it to Valinor.\n\nIn the woods of Rhovanion the Silvan and Nandor settled while the Green-Elves settled the forests of Ossiriand and the Ered Luin. The Sindar made their home in Doriath after tarrying there to try to find their leader Elwë, who had become enraptured with the Maia Melian. Last were the Falathrim who settled the coasts of Beleriand, taking Nowë (in later years known as Círdan) as their lord.\n\nFinally, those remaining few that completed the Great Journey to Valinor under the leadership of Olwë founded the city of Alqualondë, the Haven of the Swans, and became known as the Falmari."
 explore_history.1005.a:0 "A lesson in perseverance, and the rewards of seeing things through to the end."
 explore_history.1005.b:0 "Why rush to Valinor when there is so much wonder in Middle-Earth!"
 explore_history.1005.c:0 "These Teleri must have been harder to herd than cats! And how can you just... lose a king?"

 # Of Fëanor and the Disquiet of the Noldor

 explore_history.1011.t:0 "The Youth of Fëanor"
 explore_history.1011.desc:0 "In Valinor, when the world was young, King Finwë of the Ñoldor wed Míriel who was called Serindë, because of her skill in needlework. She bore him a son, whom she called Fëanor, Spirit of Fire. But Míriel said to Finwë : "Never again shall I bear a son, for the strength that would have nourished many has gone forth into Fëanor". After which she departed to rest in the gardens of Lórien, never to wake again.\n\nFinwë grieved much for the departure of his wife, and all his love he gave to his son. Fëanor grew fast and stong, subtle in mind and skilled in hand, the greatest in mind and body of the Children of Iluvatar. He devised the Tengwar which Men and Elves use to this day to write their speech, marvellous gems and seeing-stones that are called Palantíri.\n\nEarly in life Fëanor wedded Nerdanel, daughter of Mahtan, a smith beloved of Aulë, who taught much to his son-in-law. Nerdanel was wise and patient, and alone was she able to sway Fëanor's counsel, at times. Together they sired seven sons."
 explore_history.1011.a:0 "Such wonders he crafted!"
 explore_history.1011.b:0 "Having seven sons is a guaranteed succession nightmare"
 explore_history.1011.c:0 "I too would have loved to rest in the gardens of Lorien, if only for a while"
 
 explore_history.1012.t:0 "The Unchaining of Morgoth"
 explore_history.1012.desc:0 "Though he loved his son greatly, Finwë desired companionship again, and new children. Manwë granted his request and Finwë married Indis of the Vanyar, who bore him two sons: Fingolfin the valiant, and Finarfin the wise. Fëanor loved his father deeply, but ever begrudged Indi, and he lived apart from them, exploring every corner of Aman or busying himself with the crafting of new things.\n\nThen it came that Morgoth the Dark Enemy was released from bondage by the Valar after being held for three ages of the world in the Halls of Mandos, and he took fair form and feigned friendship with the Ñoldor, bringing them hidden knowledge in which they delighted. \n\nFor he hated Elves, deeming them the cause for his downfall. The Vanyar would not hear his counsel, content in the light of the Trees, and the Teleri he tought of little worth. In the Ñoldor, ever eager for knowledge and craftsmanship, he found the unknowing agents for his schemes. And Morgoth whispered to the ears of the Ñoldor and planted the seeds of strife among themselves and against the Valar. But chief of all he hated Fëanor, who refused his counsel and was wary of his words."
 explore_history.1012.a:0 "How could Manwë release Morgoth? It was generous but very unwise"
 explore_history.1012.b:0 "Agents who are unaware of your schemes can never betray them"
 explore_history.1012.c:0 "The Teleri were great shipwrights, that has to be worth something"
 
 explore_history.1013.t:0 "The Silmarils and the Unquiet of the Ñoldor"
 explore_history.1013.desc:0 "Fëanor was filled with foreboding, and feared that the blessed days of the Noontide of Valinor could come to an end. He pondered how to preserve the light of the two trees, Laurelin the golden and Telperion the silver. He devised the Silmarils: three great jewels, protecting the light of the Trees in vessels that no force or violence could break. Yet they were no mere crystals, and the light burned within them and gave them life, and they rejoiced in light received and shone all the brighter.\n\nAll rejoiced and marvelled at the work of Fëanor, and Varda blessed the Silmarils, so that no hands unclean or anything of evil might touch them without being burnt by their fire. And Morgoth lusted after them, and in his desire, he strove ever to destroy Fëanor and the friendship between the Elves and the Valar.\n\nMorgoth told the Elves that the Valar kept them in Aman as in a golden cage, for they were jealous of their craft and their art, so that Men may supplant them in the Kingdoms of Middle-Earth."
 explore_history.1013.a:0 "Could that material be employed for other uses? Like armouring?"
 explore_history.1013.b:0 "If the Valar hadn’t kept so much hidden from the Elves, they might not have listened"
 explore_history.1013.c:0 "He had a point; the Elves were never supposed to hide in Aman"
 
 explore_history.1014.t:0 "The Death of the Two Trees"
 explore_history.1014.desc:0 "As Morgoth’s lies spread among the Ñoldor, the unquiet turned to factionalism. Fëanor began to speak openly of returning to Middle-Earth, for from his people (though from Morgoth's lies, in truth), he had heard Fingolfin strove to supplant him as their father's heir, with the backing of the Valar. And to Fingolfin it was told to be wary of his brother, lest he should use their father’s love towards him to strip him of everything. And so, Fingolfin came to Finwë to ask him to restrain Fëanor, disparaging his loyalty to their father; at this insult, Fëanor entered the court and pulled his sword on Fingolfin, warning him that it would prove sharper than Fingolfin's tongue.\n\nThus, the Valar finally uncovered that Morgoth was the root of the disquiet of the Noldor, and he fled before their pursuit. But for drawing his sword upon his brother, Fëanor was exiled from Tirion for twelve years, and with him to Formenos came his father and the Elves of his house. For Finwë held himself unkinged, for the Valar had unilaterally overruled him, and in that moment the lies of Morgoth seemed to Fëanor as truth for Fingolfin reigned in Tirion as regent, and it was the Valar whose actions made it so.\n\nAt the end of his exile, Fëanor was invited to a great feast in Valimar, and near all the Elves of Aman were present, and the brothers reconciled. Morgoth took advantage of that feast to strike. With the help of the great spider Ungoliant, he destroyed the Trees, and raided the vaults of Formenos, killing Finwë and stealing the Silmarils before fleeing towards Middle-Earth."
 explore_history.1014.a:0 "So much strife between brothers should be avoided"
 explore_history.1014.b:0 "To hold a great banquet while the Enemy is at the gates, such foolishness"
 explore_history.1014.c:0 "Nothing like a good feast to set things right"
 
 explore_history.1015.t:0 "The Oath of Fëanor"
 explore_history.1015.desc:0 "The Valar asked Fëanor to give his Silmarils to Yavanna, so that she might heal the Trees. At this Fëanor was filled with anguish and indecision, for the jewels were as such he could never again make, and to unmake them would be to unmake himself. And then once more the lies of Morgoth arose anew, and Fëanor percieved the Valar too as Morgoth's kin, and that he would not yield them save by force - and that it would but prove all his fears of them right. Then messengers came bearing the news of the death of Finwë and the theft of the Silmarils. Grieved now beyond consolement (for he had loved his father above all the works of his hands), Fëanor fled into the night, whence none could find him. \n\nMany days passed, ere in darkened Tirion Fëanor appeared again, an all-consuming fire within him. He spoke words of rebuke and power, bidding his people join him in his quest for vengeance. To show their resolve, he and his sons swore a terrible oath, known only thereafter as the [oathoffeanor|E]. \n\nFëanor's will and words were so great, he prevailed against those who preached for caution, and all the hosts of the Ñoldor made to depart."
 explore_history.1015.a:0 "Words with which to shake the world!"
 explore_history.1015.b:0 "Will the Valar ever do anything?"
 explore_history.1015.c:0 "A fool is he who swears an oath he cannot fulfill or break"

# The Flight of the Ñoldor
 
 explore_history.1021.t:0 "Setting off from Tirion"
 explore_history.1021.desc:0 "After Fëanor and his sons had taken their fateful Oath, dissension began to arise between the Ñoldor. For though they had agreed to depart, not all wished for Fëanor to assume the kingship. And so they began to muster, the House of Fëanor and the Elves from Formenos in the van, and the greater part of the host following Fingolfin and Finarfin.\n\nAs the Ñoldor were fully mustered, and only one in ten would stay behind for the love of Tirion, the herald of Manwë announced that the Valar would not aid or hinder the departure of the Ñoldor, but advised against it, rebuking Fëanor for the folly of his quest. Fëanor and his sons were exiled from Aman on account of the oath they had taken.\n\nBut Fëanor laughed, and asked of his people whether they would see the heir of their King exiled alone, or seek their freedom with him. After, he turned to the herald and bid him tell Manwë, “If Fëanor cannot overthrow Morgoth, at least he delays not to assault him, and sits not idle in grief. And it may be that Eru has set in me a fire greater than thou knowest.”\n\nAnd the herald bowed as one answered in full by an equal, before departing. After this the Ñoldor host left the gates of Tirion."
 explore_history.1021.a:0 "Fëanor had such sway over his people, to mobilize them so"
 explore_history.1021.b:0 "He who defies the counsel of the Valar does so at their own risks"
 explore_history.1021.c:0 "For that many people on a long road he would need to be well supplied"
                   
 explore_history.1022.t:0 "The First Kinslaying"
 explore_history.1022.desc:0 "Fëanor led the host northwards, following the road Morgoth had taken. But as his mind cooled and he took counsel, he perceived that the great companies of the Ñoldor could not travel the long leagues to the north or cross the sea without ships. He resolved to convince the Teleri to join them in their rebellion.\n\nBut the Teleri were unmoved by his words, and would not lend their ships or aid in the making of new ones against the will of the Valar. For their ships were as dear to them the gems of the Ñoldor. Fëanor was angered by these words, and once enough of the Ñoldor had joined him, he began to man the ships and to take them away by force. But the Teleri would not let them, and threw elves overboard. Swords were drawn and a battle between kin began.\n\nThrice they were cast back out, and thrice they came to the assault, helped by the House of Fingolfin. Finding the battle joined, they came to the help of Fëanor, no knowing how it had started. Finally the Ñoldor prevailed, and fled on the stolen ships."
 explore_history.1022.a:0 "Slaughter in paradise, so starts the work of Morgoth"
 explore_history.1022.b:0 "The Teleri will be re-embodied by Mandos anyway..."
 explore_history.1022.c:0 "No army could hope to make such a march..."
                   
 explore_history.1023.t:0 "The Doom of Mandos"
 explore_history.1023.desc:0 "The sea rose in wrath against the Kinslayers, and many of the stolen ships were lost, but at last the greater part of the Ñoldor regrouped north of Alqualondë, some on ships and some on foot. After marching a great while in the enduring night, a dark figure rose on the mountains overhead. Some say it was Mandos himself, the Doomsayer of the Valar. And thus was pronounced the [doomofmandos|E].\n\nAt those words Finarfin and many of his people turned back, and returned to Tirion. But Fëanor hardened his heart, and laid his own doom upon that of the Valar - whatever the end, the tales of the Noldor would endure until the end of Arda itself."
 explore_history.1023.a:0 "The House of Fëanor is no more, but the Doom remains. Vala justice is harsh"

 explore_history.1024.t:0 "Burning his vessels"
 explore_history.1024.desc:0 "At last the Ñoldor reached the northern end of Aman, and they could see the first teeth of ice floating in the sea, detached from the Helcaraxë, the chaos of ice filling the strait between Valinor and Middle-Earth. As they started to feel the anguish of the cold winds and the clinging mists, the followers of Fingolfin began to curse Fëanor as the source of all their troubles, and Fingolfin took for himself the name [finwenolofinwe|E].\n\nFëanor and his sons took counsel, for they could see but two roads ahead: the ships or the Helcaraxë. But the ships were too few, and the Helcaraxë too daunting. They resolved to sail away secretly with the members of their House, leaving the followers of Fingolfin stranded on the shore.\n\nThey quickly crossed the sea, born by a quick wind. But when Maedhros asked of his father who should go and ferry the remaining Ñoldor, he laughed and ordered the ships burned, bidding those that cursed him so to return to the cages of the Valar. Seeing the great fire from the shores of Aman, the House of Fingolfin was dismayed, but they refused to turn back. Along the long deadly road of the Helcaraxë they went, and many were lost in its treacherous crevasses."

 explore_history.1025.desc:0 "The House of Fëanor moved on from the firth of Drengist, passed into Hithlum and established their encampment on the shores of Lake Mithrim. Morgoth, returned to his old fortress of Angband, had also seen the great fire of the ships. But he feared the Ñoldor little, for their strength in arms was yet untested. So before their camp was full-wrought, the Elves were assaulted by the hosts of Angband./n/n The Ñoldor were outnumbred and taken unawares, yet they swiftly prevailed for they were deadly in anger, and their swords were long and terrible. This was called the Dagor-nuin-Giliath, the Battle under the Stars, for the Sun and Moon had not yet risen from Valinor. Ten days that battle lasted, and the Orcs were driven from Hithlum with great slaughter, and the havens of Cirdan were relieved, and Beleriand liberated. But Fëanor, in his wrath at the Enemy, pressed forward behind the remains of the army, thinking to defeat Morgoth himself, and that was his undoing.\n\n From the gates of Angband came forth the Balrogs, spirits of fire descended in the Arda with Morgoth, fell and deadly. Against them Fëanor and his guard fought long and valiantly, but he fell under the blows of Gothmog, Lord of the Balrogs. So passed Fëanor, greatest of the Children of Ilúvatar."

 explore_history.2001.desc:0 "After their victory in the Dagor Aglareb, the reunited Ñoldor assumed defensive positions encircling Thangorodrim, unwilling yet to assail it, perceiving they could not at the time overcome it. They deemed that the time had come to make their realms in peace and grow strong over the long years. Thus, the realms of Beleriand solidified into the forms they would hold for much of the First Age, guarded behind the swords of the Ñoldor.\n\nIn the mountain deeps of Beleriand the Dwarven clans of the Broadbeams and Firebeards made their homes in the great halls of Belegost (Gabilgathol) and Nogrost (Tumunzahar). These were the westernmost mansions of the Dwarves, and prosperous in their day. They traded with both the Sindar and the Ñoldor of eastern Beleriand and were counted close allies of the House of Fëanor. Some of the dwarves of Nogrod aided Finrod Felagund in the creation of his subterranean city of Nargothrond."

Maedhros the Tall, head of the house, made his home in the great fortress of Himring, set high atop a hill east of the Pass of Aglon and west of Maglor's Gap. He dwelt there with Maglor, who sallied forth with his cavalry to patrol the Gap.\n\nCelegorm and Curufin made their abode in Himlad, and fortified Aglon, the pass through which one passed from Himring into Dorthonion. Caranthir and his people settled on the shores of Lake Helevorn. Through Caranthir’s land flowed all trade from the Dwarven realms of Nogrod and Belegost, and through his realm came all the waves of men that would eventually come into Beleriand. He was no fan of the Dwarves, or of the Men that came through his lands, but they made him fabulously wealthy.\n\nAmrod and Amras, the youngest of the sons of Fëanor, made their home in the great plains of southern Beleriand. The least active of the Sons of Fëanor in the Siege, their realm was one which helped supply their northern kin with food and supplies for the war."

Scandalised by the preposterous demand, Thingol agreed but with one seemingly impossible condition: that Beren bring him one of Fëanor’s Silmarils from the Iron Crown of Morgoth.\n\nDespair gripped Beren, and he left the hall of Thingol and the woods of Doriath to seek the help of Finrod Felagund king of Noldorin Nargothrond, who of old had sworn to help his family when in need. Finrod was true to his word but Celegorm and Curufin, two of Fëanor’s sons, guests at Nargothrond, summoned images of war and ruin should the King help Beren steal a Silmaril.\n\nAnd so Finrod relinquished his crown to his brother and set forth, with Beren and ten companions towards Angband.

Indeed the name ‘Bellakar’ appeared to have been derived from an Avarin equivalent to the Sindarin name for the sea, ‘Belegaer’. Similarly, the local name for the coast, ‘Felaya’, seemed related to the Sindarin word ‘Falas’. \n\nSoon The Númenóreans began to settle among the Bellanarod, building great settlements along the coast.

Further havens were established along the coast in the following centuries: Osto Nórëanarva (Ûrêzâyan) in 1644, and Sornomar (Narîk-Zadan) in 1780, and Korlea in 1975. \n\nMany of the Adûnâi intermingled with the native Bellanarod, and a distinct people of mixed blood began to emerge - the Bellakaze. Yet in many cities the Adûnâi kept all power in their own hands, and the local oligarchies were often restricted to those with pure Adûnâi blood. In others, the Bellakaze began to exercise more influence. The Bellanarod became increasingly marginalised as the Adûnâi grew in strength and arrogance, sowing the seeds of many future conflicts. \n\nIn 2022 Tar-Ciryatan decreed the formation of the Council of Free Cities, giving the cities of Bellakar a loose confederal government."

This eased tensions among the Adûnâi, but did little to conciliate the native element. To the Bellanarod, domination by Nîlûlôni differed little from life under the thumb of Korlea, and Númenor’s overweening pride of race caused the Bellakaze to be gradually stripped of political power, while its increasing decadence and greed crushed the Bellanarod with taxes and tribute. \n\nSauron used these dissensions provoke rebellions among the native population, which required the intervention of Pharazôn son of Gimilkhâd, kinsman of Tar-Palantir the king, who led the Númenórean reprisal against Sauron’s incursions.

Through companionship in arms and blood shed together, the Éothéod became well-known to Gondor as a people in whom they could trust.\n\nTwo years later, after the fall of Angmar, Lord Frumgar led the Éothéod to a new land north of Mirkwood, between the Misty Mountains and the Forest River, away from the ravages of the Easterlings and Orcs. In time, this land also came to be known as Éothéod as Frumgar's people made their homes there.\n\nSome time later their king Fram, son of Frumgar, slew the dragon Scatha and the Éothéod capital was named Framsburg in his honour."

 explore_history.4003.desc:0 "In T.A. 2510, the fierce Easterlings known as the Balchoth waged open war against a weakened Gondor, crossing the Anduin and passing into the north of Calenardhon. In desperate hope, they sent word to their ancient Éothéod allies seeking aid, but received no response.\n\nThe Balchoth faced little resistance as they ran rampant through the mostly abandoned province, and by the time the Northern Army of Gondor sallied forth from their fortresses, the bulk of the enemy's army had already arrived. In a valiant counter attack by the ruling Steward Cirion, Gondor managed to drive the Balchoth back to the Wold, only to find themselves cut off as the reinforcing Southern Army was assailed en route by an orcish band descending from the mountains.\n\nThus, the Steward and his fellow Dúnedain found themselves backed against the river in a hopeless situation."

Eorl perceived then that if Gondor should fall, no land would long live free from the Darkness, and that the Éothéod should brave even the terror of Dol Guldur if needed to secure that freedom.\n\nLong and hard did they ride, coming South at a speed beyond hope. The Éothéod crossed the Anduin at the Undeeps of the river and with a great blaring of horns, a thundering charge came onto the rear-guard of the Balchoth.\n\nSet upon with a deep terror, the Balchoth broke before the fury of the Northmen and the Gondorian armies were saved, with the Éothéod continuing their foray into northern Gondor, scattering and destroying all the Balchoth in Calenardhon."

There he led him to the hidden tomb of Elendil the Tall, where he offered to Eorl and his people all the lands of Calenardhon from Anduin to Isen, in solemn recognition of the great valour and sacrifice of the Éothéod, with the sole condition that the Éothéod should dwell there forever a friend to Gondor, and that they should share friend and foe alike.\n\nAwed by the magnanimity of this gift, Eorl accepted in the name of his people and there, upon the tomb of Elendil, did the Steward and King swear a great oath, affirming what they had said before.\n\nEorl then returned to the north, to bring his people to settle Calenardhon, while Cirion returned south to Minas Tirith. Thus, was the Oaths of Eorl and Cirion sworn, and the people of Gondor and Rohan bound perpetually in friendship and alliance against all foes."
