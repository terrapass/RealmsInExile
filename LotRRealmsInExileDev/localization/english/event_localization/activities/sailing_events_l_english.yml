# History Exploration Start Event

sailing.1001.t:0 "A Ship! My Kingdom for a Ship!"
sailing.1001.desc:0 "While discussing my recent desire to go sailing on the high seas, my Steward asks if I even have a vessel fit for such an endeavour. Scouring my memory, I realize that I don't actually have such a ship.\n\nSo, what to do then? I could charter a ship for this voyage, which would be significantly cheaper; but if I plan on doing this often, perhaps the costs would become greater than a single large investment in purchasing a vessel?"
sailing.1001.a:0 "I'll charter a ship."
sailing.1001.b:0 "Grab me a shipwright, I need a personal vessel!"
sailing.1001.c:0 "Nobody told me there'd be ships involved, I'm out!"

sailing.1002.t:0 "A Chartered Ship"
sailing.1002.desc:0 "Making my way down to the dockyards where I wish to take off, I survey my options. There are three good vessels, each with advantages and disadvantages.\n\nThe first is a relatively small but nimble craft, similar to those often used for riverine trade. Cheap, but perhaps would not fare the best upon the fierce open seas.\n\nThe next is a solidly built trading vessel, with a large deck, good accommodations, and a sizeable cargo hold. A decent all-rounder.\n\nFinally my gaze turns to a proud, princely vessel, towering above the rest, designed to carry a huge amount of crew, goods, and supplies. With fine woodworking and the captain's quarters bearing gold leaf, it is a ship worthy of a king. However, I shrink back a little upon hearing the price!"
sailing.1002.a:0 "We're not expecting any rough weather - the small craft will do."
sailing.1002.b:0 "Dependable and well-priced - the medium vessel will do."
sailing.1002.c:0 "I'm a [ROOT.Char.GetTitleAsNameNoTooltip]! Nothing less than the best for me!"

sailing.1003.t:0 "A Personal Ship"
sailing.1003.desc:0 "I summon the shipwrights to discuss my options and many present their work, but in the end I narrow it down to three different models.\n\nThe first is a small, sleek craft, designed for speed and manoeuvrability. It's the smallest of the lot, but also the cheapest.\n\nThe second is a medium sized vessel, with decent accommodations, hull-size, and a large cargo hold - it would make a fine ship.\n\nThen, I contemplate the final model. Its masts pierce the skies, massive sails unfurled to catch the wind - this is a flagship worthy of a great lord. With fine crew quarters and vast supply-holds, it is a vessel with few peers. But the price! I wince at the thought of my steward's reaction."
sailing.1003.a:0 "...the nimble, sleek craft."
sailing.1003.b:0 "...the stout, dependable trader's ship."
sailing.1003.c:0 "...the mighty flagship, fit for a [ROOT.Char.GetTitleAsNameNoTooltip]!"

sailing.1004.t:0 "A Damaged Ship"
sailing.1004.desc:0 "As my ship berths in the dockyard, the whole crew can see it has definitely seen better days. Wood creaks and rots, boards are missing or damaged, and on the whole it has been battered by its time on the high seas.\n\nBeside the pristine, well-maintained ships it sits alongside, my proud vessel is a... shall we say, unique sight.\n\nNow that I'm at the docks, it would be a simple matter for the shipwrights to repair the damage, for a small fee of course... But do I really need to?"
sailing.1004.a:0 "Repair it, I'm not trusting my life to chance!"
sailing.1004.b:0 "It'll hold together just fine."

sailing.1005.t:0 "Dockyard Temptation"
sailing.1005.desc:0 "As I walk around the docks before setting off on my voyage, an attractive [hooker.GetWomanMan] approaches me with a glimmer in [hooker.GetHerHis] eye.\n\n"Care for a little fun before you set off Sailor?"\n\nI still have plenty of things to do to prepare for the journey ahead, but there is still some time..."
sailing.1005.a:0 ""How about a LOT of fun, [hooker.GetFirstNameNoTooltip]? I'll see you again soon!""
sailing.1005.b:0 ""Nothing wrong with a harmless bit of fun right?""
sailing.1005.c:0 ""Away with you foul [hooker.GetWomanMan]!""

sailing.1006.t:0 "A Knife in the Bedroom"
sailing.1006.desc:0 "As I lay back in bed, invigorated and satisfied, I smile widely as I see [hooker.GetFirstNameNoTooltip] climb on top of me and loosen [hooker.GetHerHis] robe.\n\nHowever, any hopes of a second round quickly turn to dust as [hooker.GetHerHis] face fills with intensity and [hooker.GetSheHe] raises a dagger high above [hooker.GetHerHis] head, laughing as [hooker.GetSheHe] brings the blade down.\n\n"A gift from the Dark One, foolish [ROOT.Char.GetTitleAsNameNoTooltip]!""
sailing.1006.a:0 ""[hooker.GetFirstNameNoTooltip]! Wait... no!""
sailing.1006.a.desc:0 "You do everything you can to divert the blade:"
sailing.1006.duel_success:0 "Against all odds, you snatch the dagger away and place [hooker.GetHerHim] under arrest"
sailing.1006.duel_failure:0 "You feel the dagger dig deep into your chest as your vision slowly fades to black"

sailing.1007.t:0 "Whittle While You Wait"
sailing.1007.desc:0 "As I wander around the docks waiting for supplies to be loaded onto the boat, my ennui is interrupted by the sound of scraping wood. Following the sound, I find my crewmate [whittler.GetFirstNameNoTooltip] carving a small and intricate figurine from a piece of timber.\n\nLooking up from [whittler.GetHerHis] work, [whittler.GetFirstNameNoTooltip] smiles and calls me over. "Hello [ROOT.Char.GetFirstNameNoTooltip]. Care to join me in a spot of whittling?"\n\nIt looks like it requires nimble work with the knife, but I'm sure I could make something if I tried..."
sailing.1007.a:0 "I'll make a little something for my child."
sailing.1007.b:0 "I'll make a sweet memento for my love."
sailing.1007.c:0 "I'll make a flute to set my lyrics to music."
sailing.1007.d:0 "I'll make something simple, just to pass the time away."
sailing.1007.e:0 "I'd rather not waste my time with idle work."

sailing.1008.t:0 "Bar Brawl"
sailing.1008.desc:0 "It is the night before our voyage and I've been enjoying myself at a local tavern, drinking and eating with my crew. Spirits are high and there's been much laughter as everyone tries to one up the others' seafaring stories.\n\nSuddenly, over the hum of the drunken patrons I hear raised voices at the bar, flaring in argument. Straining my eyes, I soon see that one of them is my crewmate [brawler.GetFirstNameNoTooltip].\n\nThe disagreement quickly escalates to a full on shouting match, spit flying. Before long, fists are raised, and [brawler.GetFirstNameNoTooltip] calls out for help against the group of burly ruffians."
sailing.1008.a:0 ""Surely there's a better way to resolve this?""
sailing.1008.a.success:0 "You quickly diffuse the situation, calming the ruffians down"
sailing.1008.a.failure:0 "Your efforts fall on deaf ears and you're both given a beating for your audacity"
sailing.1008.b:0 ""I'm coming [brawler.GetFirstNameNoTooltip]!""
sailing.1008.b.success:0 "You and [brawler.GetFirstNameNoTooltip] make short work of the ruffians"
sailing.1008.b.failure:0 "You and [brawler.GetFirstNameNoTooltip] are given a solid beating by the ruffians"
sailing.1008.c:0 ""You're on your own [brawler.GetFirstNameNoTooltip]...""

sailing.1009.t:0 "Drinking Contest"
sailing.1009.desc:0 "The hour has grown very late indeed, and having had more than a few drinks, my crew are up to their usual antics, sharing tales and boasts about their prowess and past conquests.\n\nSlightly unsteady, my crewmate [challenger.GetFirstNameNoTooltip] rises to [challenger.GetHerHis] feet, cup in hand, before slamming it down against the wooden table.\n\n"I've never met a brew I couldn't best! [ROOT.Char.GetFirstNameNoTooltip], fill your cup... the last on their feet wins twenty five gold pieces!""
sailing.1009.a:0 ""You think you can outlast me? You MUST be drunk...""
sailing.1009.a.success:0 "After many rounds of drink, you finally hear [challenger.GetFirstNameNoTooltip] hit the floor"
sailing.1009.a.failure:0 "The drink quickly goes to your head and you pass out"
sailing.1009.b:0 ""I could never hope to outdrink you [challenger.GetFirstNameNoTooltip]!""

sailing.1010.t:0 "Fortune Teller"
sailing.1010.desc:0 "As I walk along the waterfront, watching the masts of the ships bob up and down with the rolling of the waves, I hear the voice of an old crone by a small wagon at the side of the road, beckoning me closer.\n\nAs I approach, she collects an assortment of rune-carved stones from the small ornate table in front her into a velvet bag, shaking it before drawing five and laying them in a neat line.\n\n"Good day sailor. These mystic stones were imbued with magical power by the Drû of old and have the power to deliver an omen of for your journey ahead, if you will only cross my palm with silver...""
sailing.1010.a:0 "Let me hear what these stones have to say..."
sailing.1010.a.success.t:0 "The omens are good!"
sailing.1010.a.success:0 "The stones portent good tidings for your journey and the coming years"
sailing.1010.a.failure.t:0 "The omens are ill!"
sailing.1010.a.failure:0 "The stones portent ill tidings for your journey and the coming years"
sailing.1010.b:0 "I won't waste money on a charlatan with a handful of rocks!"

sailing.1011.t:0 "A Dockyard Delicacy"
sailing.1011.desc:0 "It is the morning of my voyage and I am walking along the docks towards my vessel with my crewmate [fellow_diner.GetFirstNameNoTooltip].\n\nWe are chatting about our upcoming adventure when I see [fellow_diner.GetHerHis] nostrils flare and a wide smile spread across [fellow_diner.GetHerHis] face. Pulling me by the arm, [fellow_diner.GetSheHe] follows the smell to a ramshackle food stall nestled between two warehouses.\n\n"I can't believe this place still exists! They make the most amazing soup that you just have to try, it'll set you up perfectly for our trip!"\n\nI watch as [fellow_diner.GetSheHe] eagerly grabs a bowl and starts to eat, but I can't help but to hesitate. The kitchen is filthy and rank with an overwhelming smell of seasoning and spice. Still, [fellow_diner.GetFirstNameNoTooltip] seems to like it... Maybe this is the authentic street food experience!"
sailing.1011.a:0 "Try the food... You only live once!"
sailing.1011.a.success.t:0 "The meal was delicious!"
sailing.1011.a.success:0 "The meal was delicious, leaving you feeling full and ready for the journey"
sailing.1011.a.too_spicy.t:0 "The meal was far too spicy!"
sailing.1011.a.too_spicy:0 "The spice in the meal was unpleasantly strong, leaving you in a hot sweat"
sailing.1011.a.failure.t:0 "I don't feel so good..."
sailing.1011.a.failure:0 "The poorly prepared meal leaves you feeling rotten and sick ahead of the morning's sail"
sailing.1011.b:0 ""Are you mad? Look how filthy those dishes are!""

sailing.1012.t:0 "An Aerial Attack!"
sailing.1012.desc:0 "As I'm walking down the pier, mentally tallying our supplies for the journey ahead, I suddenly feel a sharp impact on my head. Lifting my hand to my head, I gingerly press my now gooey temple, spinning around to find the one who would be brave enough to attack me like this!\n\nBeside me, my crewmate [laugher.GetFirstNameNoTooltip] bursts out laughing, before proceeding to point towards the end of the pier. \n\n"I think you'll find your attacker over there my [ROOT.Char.GetTitleAsNameNoTooltip]!"\n\nLooking at the end of the pier, I finally understand, a solitary seagull is resting on the pier, staring at me intently. Lowering my hand, I can now make out the fact that I have been pooped upon."
sailing.1012.a:0 ""The deadliest warrior I've ever faced!""
sailing.1012.b:0 ""You DARE to laugh at me? I'll have your hide!""
#sailing.1012.c:0 ""Someone grab me a bow, I want grilled gull!""

sailing.1013.t:0 "An Experienced Sailor"
sailing.1013.desc:0 "After reviewing my crew lists, I am alarmed to discover we are down a few men from what we would usually have aboard. While not particularly harmful to the expedition, I would prefer to have a fully manned ship.\n\nAfter looking around the usual haunts of the port, I hear about [recruit.GetFirstNameNoTooltip], a well travelled sailor who has seen many voyages. I finally track [recruit.GetHerHim] down, but to my dismay [recruit.GetSheHe] has already signed on with another crew!\n\nTurning upon hearing you approach, [recruit.GetFirstNameNoTooltip] raises an eyebrow.\n\n"Is there something I can help you with?"
sailing.1013.a:0 "I have quite an opportunity to offer you..."
sailing.1013.a.success:0 "You successfully convince the mariner to join your crew"
sailing.1013.a.failure:0 "You fail to convince the mariner"
sailing.1013.b:0 "Tell me, what is your usual fare? I'll double it!"
sailing.1013.c:0 "We have enough sailors, we'll be fine"

sailing.1014.t:0 "A Day at the Market"
sailing.1014.desc:0 "As the ship is being loaded with supplies, I take the time to wander the local markets.\n\nMany merchants shout out, attempting to advertise their wares to me. There are some truly exotic things here, foods I have never tasted and books in tongues I cannot comprehend. There are also some solid selections of alcohol - I know the crew would most definitely appreciate if I came back with that!\n\nDoes anything here strike my fancy?"
sailing.1014.a:0 "That book looks interesting!"
sailing.1014.a.tt:0 "Chance to increase your Mariner trait progress"
sailing.1014.a.success.toast:0 "You gained bonus experience as a Mariner"
sailing.1014.a.failure.toast:0 "You did not gain experience as a Mariner"
sailing.1014.b:0 "Pass the booze and praise [ROOT.Char.GetFaith.HighGodName]!"
sailing.1014.c:0 "Oranges? A curious fruit indeed!"
sailing.1014.d:0 "I'm quite good, thank you"

sailing.1990.t:0 "Into the Great Ocean"
sailing.1990.desc:0 "As my ship lurches out of port, my first mate [first_mate.GetFirstNameNoTooltip] comes to my side.\n\n"So, where are we off to Captain?"\n\nTurning to [first_mate.GetHerHim], a grin breaks upon my windswept face, as the spirit of adventure wells within me.\n\n"We are...""

sailing.2001.b:0 "You won't catch me gambling!"


sailing.2002.t:0 "A Ship in Trouble"
sailing.2002.desc:0 "While travelling along the shore not far from port, one of my crew on lookout cries out saying that he has spotted a local vessel floundering in the distance.\n\nEven from here, it's clear that the ship has taken damage by rugged seas or raiders, its crew just barely keeping it afloat as they rush about on deck trying to make repairs. Clearly they are in a vulnerable position and in need of aid."
sailing.2002.a:0 "Stop and try to help them!"
sailing.2002.a.tt_success:0 "You save the crew"

sailing.2002.c:0 "Let's just sail on by."

sailing.2003.t:0 "Leviathan"
sailing.2003.desc:0 "I breathe in deeply as I walk the length of the deck, the bracing sea wind and salty air in my face. Today is a fine day to sail!\n\nThe short voyage has been an exhilarating change of pace from life at court, when we spot it: a distant plume of water, followed by a small island of wine-dark flesh rolling out of the waves.\n\nOne of the greatest beast of all the deeps.\n\nA whale!"
sailing.2003.a:0 "Get the harpoons!"
sailing.2003.a.tt_success:0 "You slaughter the whale and haul it to shore"

sailing.2003.d.tt:0 "The whale goes free."

sailing.2004.t:0 "A Battle on the High Seas"
sailing.2004.desc:0 "As we sail upon the wide open Belegaer, the sea seems calm and clear. As I stand upon the deck, basking in the sun's glow, a shout shatters the quiet. \n\n"Captain!" My first mate shouts, "Unknown ship approaching us at high speed!"\n\nQuickly rushing to the railing of my vessel, I scan the horizon, before finally picking out the dark form swiftly approaching. It is apparent what it is - a pirate ship. They will soon be upon us. Should we fight, or flee?"
sailing.2004.a:0 "Let them come!"
sailing.2004.b:0 "Hoist the sails!"

sailing.2005.t:0 "Sailor Overboard!"
sailing.2005.desc:0 "Now far out into sea, the rough seas rock us back and forth. It is difficult at times to keep your footing, but doable. \n\nSuddenly, a panicked voice rises sharply, and whirling you spot one of your sailors go over the edge! Rushing to the side, you see their head breaking through the surface, being cast around by the waves. \n\nYou must act now, or they will assuredly perish in the temptuous depths."

sailing.2006.t:0 "A Game of Cards"
sailing.2006.desc:0 "As I withdraw to my cabin for the night, I can hear sounds of a crowd coming from below deck. All deckhands not on duty are gathered around a table, and a lively game of cards is taking place, amid vapours of smoke and alcohol.\n\n"Come over Captain, [first_mate.GetFirstName] calls, we'll show you how it's done!".\n\nA shout comes from the crowd "Don't take all [ROOT.Char.GetHerHis] gold, some of it's my pay!", followed by a roar of laughter."

sailing.2007.t:0 "Insufferable Discord"
sailing.2007.desc:0 "So far the journey has proceeded smoothly, but you begin to notice grumbling from the crew. Soon an overworked crewmate, Iamizân, approaches you. He is glossy of beard, but has the worn hands of a sailor who has seen too many quays. He speaks in the brogue of the northern havens, which at times can sound like code, but his exasperation is clear.\n\n“Tis a fine crew sire, and hardworking. But it is our passengers who cause dissension! They were given free passage, and do not pay for their board, yet their complaints are constant! And it’s always the same complaint! No matter how many glorious ports we visit in the realms of men, or how many rich cultures they get to see, all we ever hear from them is “Elves! Elves! When will we visit the Elves? What will the Elves be like!” It’s driving the crew mad!” \n\nYou know that Iamizân speaks truly. And the passengers have no excuse. Upon boarding they were shown the scrolls containing the ship's itinerary, and they should know that we will not visit Elven lands until the third leg of the voyage. If something isn’t done you fear the crew may mutiny!""

They say our actions have angered [ROOT.Char.GetFaith.WaterGodName], we need to make an offering to appease [ROOT.Char.GetFaith.WaterGodHerHim]."\n\nThis all sounds like nonsense to me, but making a gesture would increase morale."
