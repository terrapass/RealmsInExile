beorning.0001.t:0 "The honey incident"
beorning.0001.desc:0 "You wake up to the sound of a familiar voice, someone trying to burst into the room in an agitated state.\n\n“My liege! We have been raided in the night! The hives have been torn apart! There is honeycomb scattered across the courtyard! The bees are in a frenzy! We must...”"

beorning.0002.t:0 "The honey incident"
beorning.0002.desc:0 "You let [advisor.GetFirstNameNoTooltip] in. [advisor.GetSheHe|U] stops speaking and stares at you, mouth agape. You follow his gaze down to your body. You realise that it is matted with honey and crushed bees, along with a score of angry welts where you have been stung. As you bite your lower lip in consternation, you realise that it, too, is coated in sweet unctuousness.\n\nYou glance back up at your manservant, who is already backing out of the room. My liege.... never mind."
beorning.0002.a:0 "Well, this is embarrassing..."

beorning.0003.t:0 "The honey incident"
beorning.0003.desc:0 "You understand this is one of those times where you lost control of yourself while...transforming into a bear. Before you see or talk to anybody else, you first need to figure out the mess you have left behind."

beorning.0003.toast.a.success:0 "Trait received!"

beorning.0011.t:0 "A mountain raid"
beorning.0011.desc:0 "You smell them first. Drifting down from the foothills, a stench of filth and old blood. You follow the scent, feeling the anger - and hunger - grow within you. Soon you can hear them too, harsh cackles and shouts, and the clattering of iron and steel.\n\nThe clouds part as you lumber to the edge of a clearing. You see them now, gathered around a crackling fire - a score of mountain goblins, arguing in their guttural tongue. Are they hunting for wild beasts, or preparing to raid the settlements down below?"
beorning.0011.a:0 "Destroy the mountain goblins"
beorning.0011.a.success:0 "You destroy the party of goblins"

beorning.0012.t:0 "A mountain raid"
beorning.0012.desc:0 "They do not expect to encounter an enemy this close to the mountains. You are in amongst them before they know it. You revel in your bestial strength, crushing each foe in turn with paw and jaw. Some try to flee. You pursue them. They die."
beorning.0012.a:0 "Rawwww!"

beorning.0013.t:0 "A mountain raid"
beorning.0013.desc:0 "They do not expect to encounter an enemy this close to the mountains. You are in amongst them before they know it. You revel in your bestial strength with paw and jaw. The goblin party flees in panic."
beorning.0013.a:0 "Rawwww!"

beorning.0014.t:0 "A mountain raid"
beorning.0014.desc:0 "When all is done you lumber back down into the valley, the head of the largest orc still between your jaws. On the morrow it will be found on a spike before set before your hall - as a trophy, and as a warning."
beorning.0014.a:0 "Rawwww!"

beorning.0021.t:0 "A lost homeland"
beorning.0021.desc:0 "Something drew you here, as it often does. An irresistible call. Slowly you lumber up the hillsides, over the foothills, up into the high valleys. You pass many beasts along your path, but they do not flee; they sense your mood.\n\nFinally you ascend a crag, and sit looking out over the valley below. You were born and raised in the lowlands, but here, in the mountains - this is your true home. The home of your ancestors. You know it in your blood. You stare up at the moon, which seems to stare back at you. It has witnessed all the history of your people. Perhaps one days it will see them fulfil their destiny. To drive out your foes, and return to your mountain homes."
beorning.0021.a:0 "I should make my ancestors proud"
beorning.0021.toast.a.success:0 "Piety obtained!"
beorning.0021.toast.b.success:0 "Dynasty prestige obtained!"

beorning.0022.t:0 "A lost homeland"
beorning.0022.desc:0 "In the distance you see the first ochre hints of dawn. It is time to return to the valley below. You tear yourself from your reverie and bound back down the slope. But you know you will return to this place, as surely as the rising of the sun. One day… perhaps… for good."
beorning.0022.a:0 "Come back home"

beorning.0031.t:0 "The Carrock"
beorning.0031.desc:0 "Through the long evening you have paced the bounds of your lands. In your bestial form you can cover great distances in a single night, and this one has been no exception. Still, there is one last place that you wish to visit before returning to your halls, and to your mannish form.\n\nYou wade across the ford, taking the opportunity to sweep an unfortunate fish into your jaws. You reach the great eyot in the centre of the river, and bound up the steep steps. Once you emerge at the summit you take a moment to survey the surroundings. \n\nTo the east lies the Great Forest, the moonlight illuminating a glittering blanket of fog that clings to the trees. To the north and south, the great river of Wilderland, taking its serpentine path through the vale on its way to lands of which you have heard only rumour. To the west, the Mountains of Mist, upthrust shards silhouetted in the crisp moonlight.\n\nYou know that so long as you patrol these lands your enemies will be deterred, and your people will sleep safer at night."
beorning.0031.a:0 "Turn to the East (Great Forest)"
beorning.0031.b:0 "Turn to the West (Misty Mountains)"

beorning.0041.t:0 "An unexcepted arrow"
beorning.0041.desc:0 "Being able to change into the form of an enormous bear has advantages… and disadvantages.\n\nA key advantage is that you are able to patrol your lands in the form of a gigantic animal of immense strength. That usually proves to be an excellent deterrence. If you do encounter an actual enemy, be that orc, warg or black-heated man, you have a very good chance of being able to crush them to a pulp with your bestial strength.\n\nA key disadvantage is that sometimes your own people mistake you for, well, a bear. Yes they know the rumours, and know not to speak of them in polite company. Yes they know that your only interest is in protecting them. However, your lands also contain real bears, and sometimes those bears raid crops, hives, and sometimes even halls. You therefore make a habit of avoiding villages, as sometimes their inhabitants quite understandably get the wrong end of the stick. Tonight you encountered a shepherd guarding his flock."
beorning.0041.a:0 "Confront the shepherd"
beorning.0041.toast.a.success:0 "A mighty, wounded bear"
beorning.0041.toast.a.failure:0 "A wounded bear"
beorning.0041.b:0 "Flee the place"

beorning.0042.t:0 "An unexcepted arrow"
beorning.0042.desc:0 "You often forget that you are in bear form and try to attempt human actions, with unexpected consequences. This time it was not a exception.\n\nAs you decide to approach the shepherd, they run totally frightened. For a moment, you lose the shepherd from sight .... to suddenly feel the wrong end of an arrow landing in your haunch.\n\nIt’ll really hurt in the morning, and you know the wound will be difficult to explain to your physician….\n\nThe shepherd and the flock flee in panic."
beorning.0042.a:0 "A mirror may help next time"

beorning.0043.t:0 "An unexcepted arrow"
beorning.0043.desc:0 "Although you consider yourself pretty charming, you remember how unfriendly you look to humans. As you decide to flee, you can hear the laugh of the shepherd - 'Bears are not what they used to be...'"
beorning.0043.a:0 "Come back home"

beorning.9000.t:0 "Home, sweet home"
beorning.9000.desc:0 "You restore your human form, hoping your bear self won't cause much trouble next time."
beorning.9000.a:0 "Get back to your human form"
