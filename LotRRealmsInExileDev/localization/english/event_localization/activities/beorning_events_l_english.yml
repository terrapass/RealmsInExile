beorning.0001.t:0 "The Honey Incident"
beorning.0001.desc:0 "You wake up to the sound of a familiar voice, someone trying to burst into the room in an agitated state.\n\n“My liege! We have been raided in the night! The hives have been torn apart! There is honeycomb scattered across the courtyard! The bees are in a frenzy! We must...”"
beorning.0001.a:0 "Open the door"
beorning.0001.b:0 "Continue sleeping"

beorning.0002.t:0 "The Honey Incident"
beorning.0002.desc:0 "You let [advisor.GetFirstNameNoTooltip] in. After a few seconds of breathless ranting they suddenly stop speaking and stare at you, mouth agape. You follow their gaze down to your body. You realise that it is matted with honey and crushed bees, along with a score of angry welts where you have been stung. As you bite your lower lip in consternation, you realise that it, too, is coated in sweet unctuousness.\n\nYou glance back up at [advisor.GetFirstNameNoTooltip], who is already backing out of the room, stuttering apologies."
beorning.0002.a:0 "Well, this is embarrassing..."

beorning.0003.t:0 "The Honey Incident"
beorning.0003.desc:0 "Gradually the realisation dawns on you that this is one of those times where your primal urges took control while you were in bestial form. Before you see or talk to anybody else, you first need to figure out the mess you have left behind."
beorning.0003.a:0 "I need to clean up this mess first"
beorning.0003.toast.a.success:0 "Trait received!"

beorning.0011.t:0 "A Mountain Raid"
beorning.0011.desc:0 "You smell them first. Drifting down from the foothills, a stench of filth and old blood. You follow the scent, feeling the anger - and hunger - grow within you. Soon you can hear them too, harsh cackles and shouts, and the clattering of iron and steel.\n\nThe clouds part as you lumber to the edge of a clearing, illuminating the scene. You see them now, gathered around a crackling fire - a score of mountain goblins, arguing in their guttural tongue. Are they hunting for wild beasts, or preparing to raid the settlements down below?"
beorning.0011.a:0 "Attempt to slay all the goblins"
beorning.0011.a.success:0 "You destroy the party of goblins"
beorning.0011.a.failure:0 "You are wounded during the attack"
beorning.0011.toast.a.failure:0 "Wounded"
beorning.0011.b:0 "Attempt to drive the goblins off"

beorning.0011.d:0 "Retreat!"

beorning.0012.t:0 "A Mountain Raid"
beorning.0012.desc:0 "They do not expect to encounter an enemy this close to the mountains. You are in amongst them before they know it. You revel in your bestial strength, crushing each foe in turn with paw and jaw. Some try to flee. You pursue them. They die."
beorning.0012.a:0 "Rawwww!"

beorning.0013.t:0 "A Mountain Raid"
beorning.0013.desc:0 "They do not expect to encounter an enemy this close to the mountains. You are in amongst them before they know it. You revel in your bestial strength with paw and jaw. The goblin party flees in panic."
beorning.0013.a:0 "Rawwww!"

beorning.0014.t:0 "A Mountain Raid"
beorning.0014.desc:0 "When all is done you lumber back down into the valley, the head of the largest orc still between your jaws. On the morrow it will be found on a spike before set before your hall - as a trophy, and as a warning."
beorning.0014.a:0 "Rawwww!"

beorning.0021.t:0 "A Lost Homeland"
beorning.0021.desc:0 "Something drew you here, as it often does. An irresistible call. Slowly you lumber up the hillsides, over the foothills, up into the high valleys. You pass many beasts along your path, but they do not flee: they sense your mood.\n\nFinally you ascend a crag, and sit looking out over the valley below. You were born and raised in the lowlands, but here, in the mountains, is your true home. The home of your ancestors. You know it in your blood. You stare up at the moon, which seems to stare back at you. It has witnessed all the history of your people. Perhaps one days it will see them fulfil their destiny. To drive out your foes, and return to your mountain homes."
beorning.0021.a:0 "Am I worthy of my ancestors?"
beorning.0021.a.success:0 "They would be proud of me"
beorning.0021.a.failure:0 "I'm just a shadow of my dynasty"
beorning.0021.toast.a.success:0 "Major dynasty prestige obtained!"
beorning.0021.toast.a.failure:0 "Minor dynasty prestige obtained!"

beorning.0022.t:0 "A Lost Homeland"
beorning.0022.desc:0 "In the distance you see the first ochre hints of dawn. It is time to return to the valley below. You tear yourself from your reverie and bound back down the slope. But you know you will return to this place, as surely as the rising of the sun. One day… perhaps… for good."
beorning.0022.a:0 "Return home"

beorning.0031.t:0 "The Carrock"
beorning.0031.desc:0 "Through the long evening you have paced the bounds of your lands. In your bestial form you can cover great distances in a single night, and this one has been no exception. Still, there is one last place that you wish to visit before returning to your halls, and to your mannish form.\n\nYou wade across the ford, taking the opportunity to sweep an unfortunate fish into your jaws. You reach the great eyot in the centre of the river, and bound up the steep steps. Once you emerge at the summit you take a moment to survey the surroundings. \n\nTo the east lies the Great Forest, the moonlight illuminating a glittering blanket of fog that clings to the trees. To the north and south, the great river of Wilderland, taking its serpentine path through the vale on its way to lands of which you have heard only rumour. To the west, the Mountains of Mist, upthrust shards silhouetted in the crisp moonlight.\n\nYou know that so long as you patrol these lands your enemies will be deterred, and your people will sleep safer at night."
beorning.0031.a:0 "Look to the East (The Great Forest)"
beorning.0031.b:0 "Turn to the West (The Misty Mountains)"

beorning.0041.t:0 "An Unexpected Arrow"
beorning.0041.desc:0 "Being able to change into the form of an enormous bear has advantages… and disadvantages.\n\nA key advantage is that you are able to patrol your lands in the form of a gigantic animal of immense strength. That usually proves to be an excellent deterrence. If you do encounter an actual enemy - be that orc, warg or black-hearted man - you have a very good chance of being able to crush them to a pulp with your bestial strength.\n\nA key disadvantage is that sometimes your own people mistake you for, well, a bear. Yes they know the rumours, and know not to speak of them in polite company. Yes they know that your only interest is in protecting them. However, your lands also contain real bears, and sometimes those bears raid crops, hives, and sometimes even halls. You therefore make a habit of avoiding villages, as sometimes their inhabitants quite understandably get the wrong end of the stick. Tonight you encountered a shepherd guarding his flock."
beorning.0041.a:0 "Stand your ground"
beorning.0041.a.success:0 "Life teachs you a lesson"
beorning.0041.a.failure:0 "You are wounded by an arrow"
beorning.0041.toast.a.success:0 "A mighty, wounded bear"
beorning.0041.toast.a.failure:0 "A wounded bear"
beorning.0041.b:0 "Beat a hasty retreat"

beorning.0042.t:0 "An Unexpected Arrow"
beorning.0042.desc:0 "In your bear form your judgement is often clouded, leading to unfortunate consequences. This time is no exception.\n\nThe shepherd cries out in terror and turns to flee. But suddenly they find their courage, and turn to face you, bow in hand. In the blink of an eye you feel a sharp pain, as an arrow strikes deep into your haunch.\n\nIt’ll really hurt in the morning, and you know the wound will be difficult to explain to your physician..."
beorning.0042.a:0 "Ouch."

beorning.0043.t:0 "An Unexpected Arrow"
beorning.0043.desc:0 "As you beat a hasty retreat, you can hear the mocking laughter of the shepherd: "Ha! Bears aren't aren't that scary after all...""
beorning.0043.a:0 "Make a mental note to increase that shepherd's taxes"

beorning.9000.t:0 "Return to Home and Hearth"
beorning.9000.desc:0 "You restore your human form, yet you know the beast still lurks within..."
beorning.9000.a:0 "Return to your human form"
