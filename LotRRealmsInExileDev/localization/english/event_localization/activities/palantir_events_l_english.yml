 palantir.0101.t:0 "The Palantír"
 palantir.0101.desc:0 "Amongst the most coveted artifacts of the Dunedain are the Palantíri. Wrought in the ancient west by Fëanor, the seven seeing-stones were gifted to Amandil of Andúnië by the Eldar of Tol Eressëa, as comfort to the Faithful as the Shadow fell upon Númenor. Brought to Middle-earth by Elendil and his sons, the Seeing-Stones have not been used since the fall of Minas Ithil to the Witch-King, for the Wise of Gondor deemed the danger too great. Their very existence has, for centuries, been a secret of the Ruling Stewards, who feared that should its location be revealed, the enemy shall seek to steal its power. \n\nThe Palantíri are tools of farsight, allowing its bearer to perceive things unseen, in far-away lands, and to communicate with the other seeing-stones. They are dangerous tools in this age, for it takes great will to master a Palantír and bend it to one’s purpose — and even then, you do not know who else might bear another and attempt to so strike you in return. But with great strength of mind and spirit, a Palantír could be a weapon unmatched. Gazing into the Seeing-Stone might unveil secrets most important, revealing the plans of the enemy and granting insight into their strategies. \n\nShould I then use the Palantír to grow my own strength and wisdom, or is the danger simply too great?" 
 palantir.0101.a:0 "It is a boon, a weapon to be used against the enemy."
 palantir.0101.a.tt:0 "You gaze into the Palantír."
 palantir.0101.b:0 "It is too dangerous..."
 palantir.0101.b.tt:0 "You do not look into the Palantír."
 
 palantir.0102.t:0 "The Wilds of Ithilien"
 palantir.0102.desc:0 "Pulled forward into the haze of the Palantír, I fly amongst the woodland and over the River [anduin|E], seeing all that wander and gather in the boundless forest. I perceive rangers on scouting missions, gaze upon a tribe of roving Uruks, and as my foresight moves southward I begin to understand the design of an enemy incursion. They are many and speak in a tongue most unkind, but their objective becomes clear to you: they mean to raid and rob the Ithilien roads, harassing the supply lines destined for the outer defence of [gondor|E]. \n\nI send word of this to your castellan, who in turn sends a rider to warn the Rangers of Ithilien. Through your foresight, a great debacle has been averted."
 palantir.0102.a:0 "The enemy uses clever tactics, and so must we."
 palantir.0102.a.tt:0 "You gaze into the Palantír again."
 palantir.0102.b:0 "That is all the information I require."
 palantir.0102.b.tt:0 "You cease looking into the Palantír."
 
 palantir.0103.t:0 "The Plains of Harondor"
 palantir.0103.desc:0 "The winds shift, and in turn so does your gaze, moving into the open plains of Harondor. These lands are rife with open turmoil. Battles are engaged in the open fields, horses and men scream, and a flurry of arrows cut down a battalion of [haradrim|E] warriors before your very eyes. \n\nButchery, such terrible, unwarranted butchery. Long ago these lands were calm, and only the wind would disturb its inhabitants; but now the black tide of war encompasses all things living, and all one can do is hope for better times to come."
 palantir.0103.a:0 "There is peril there, as well as opportunity."
 palantir.0103.a.tt:0 "You gaze into the Palantír again."
 palantir.0103.b:0 "That is all the information I require."
 palantir.0103.b.tt:0 "You cease looking into the Palantír."
 
 palantir.0104.t:0 "The City of Pelargir"
 palantir.0104.desc:0 "At the mouths of the [anduin|E] sits the great city of Pelargir, home of the Sealords. Great vessels from along the coasts of [gondor|E] lay at anchor as mariners and guildsmen converse, spreading news of the happenings of places far-away. You hear a few of these conversations in detail, and the closer you come to the Palace of the Sealord, the more damning each story becomes. \n\nPolitics, secrets of every kind, nothing is secret when laid bare before your encompassing eye. No scandal is safe, and after a few hours of listening, you understand the political machinations of the city more than anyone else."
 palantir.0104.a:0 "Plots wrapped in plots, hidden by other plots. Such decadence!"
 palantir.0104.a.tt:0 "You gaze into the Palantír again."
 palantir.0104.b:0 "That is all the information I require."
 palantir.0104.b.tt:0 "You cease looking into the Palantír."
 
 palantir.0105.t:0 "The Deserts of Abrakhân"
 palantir.0105.desc:0 "South and East of the luscious lands of [gondor|E] lie the dry deserts of foreign Abrakhân. Caravans move along common footpaths. Half of these traders move southward to pay tribute to the Golden King, whilst half move northward to deliver tribute to the Dark Lord himself. \n\nAs you move ever-closer to the capital of the desert kingdom, things become clearer to you. Their soldiers are mustering; and even scores of Giant Scorpions gather in boundless war camps for a future offensive. Where they are going, however, remains a mystery even to you."
 palantir.0105.a:0 "They are ruled by the mystical Golden King..."
 palantir.0105.a.tt:0 "You gaze into the Palantír again."
 palantir.0105.b:0 "That is all the information I require."
 palantir.0105.b.tt:0 "You cease looking into the Palantír."
 
 palantir.0106.t:0 "The Dark Tower"
 palantir.0106.desc:0 "Sudden, sharp, all becomes silent. The landscapes are replaced by an endless void of blackness. Featureless and quiet, I think of perhaps letting go of the Palantír, but before I can, I am suddenly pulled northward. Over the mountains and fertile land of Nurn, pulled without delay towards a tower in the distance. \n\nHe sees me! Sauron sees me! He appears in the form of a great eye, lidless, wreathed in flame. My hand begins to burn, and in the ancient, foul tongue of Melkor the Dark Lord begins to voice his commands. \n\nBut I am not weak, and I will certainly be not made a slave of malice. I steel myself, and in a moment of immense clarity I break the bond with the Dark Lord. \n\nAll is quiet, again..."
 palantir.0106.a:0 "I will never be made a slave of the Dark Lord!"
 palantir.0106.a.tt:0 "You gaze into the Palantír again."
 palantir.0106.b:0 "Against such power there can be no victory..."
 palantir.0106.b.tt:0 "You cease looking into the Palantír."
 
 palantir.0107.t:0 "The Withered Tree"
 palantir.0107.desc:0 "My gaze turns to Minas Tirith itself, espying the citizens of the Tower of Guard as they go about their daily lives. Level by level, street by street, I climb, eventually arriving at the fountain of the Great Courtyard of Kings. \n\nEven now, with such peril at hand, the Fountain Guard stand vigilant, their winged helms glistening against the magnificent radiance of the sun. They guard the withered White Tree, a symbol of the fading strength of the Men of [westernesse|E] against the storm that is rising in the East."
 palantir.0107.a:0 "The strength of Gondor is failing, they will not avail us."
 palantir.0107.a.tt:0 "You gaze into the Palantír again."
 palantir.0107.b:0 "Gondor's rule is weakening..."
 palantir.0107.b.tt:0 "You cease looking into the Palantír."
 
 palantir.0108.t:0 "The Horselords"
 palantir.0108.desc:0 "The Palantír once again comes alive with light, bidding my foresight look to the rolling plains of [rohan|E]. Great hosts of horsemen gather, spears raised and ready for war.\n\nLong has it been since Eorl the Young came riding across the Fields of Celebrant, and to his sons oaths of old are but children's stories.\n\n It is said that their King pays a tribute in horses to [sauronthedarklordcharacter|E], and indeed black horses are fewer than they were among the great herds.\n\nEven fast friends of old are no longer trustworthy, I can only rely on my own strength."
 palantir.0108.a:0 "Even now they plot my demise!"
 palantir.0108.a.tt:0 "You gaze into the Palantír again."
 palantir.0108.b:0 "What terrible wickedness. I must stop..."
 palantir.0108.b.tt:0 "You cease looking into the Palantír."
 
 palantir.0109.t:0 "The Easterlings of Rhûn"
 palantir.0109.desc:0 "Once more, my gaze is pulled by force, going eastward past even the dominion of [mordor|E]. There, in the land of Rhûn, I see ancient cities of wondrous splendour bustling with life and activity. \n\nBut as my gaze focuses, it becomes clear that this form of life is corrupted in nature. The Easterlings are still counted amongst the ranks of the enemy, and even now I perceive that they plot my destruction. Hordes of men, horses, and even chariots lumber out the city gates, moving west towards the setting sun."
 palantir.0109.a:0 "Their legions grow with each passing day..."
 palantir.0109.a.tt:0 "You gaze into the Palantír again."
 palantir.0109.b:0 "Is there no end to the influence of Sauron?"
 palantir.0109.b.tt:0 "You cease looking into the Palantír."
 
 palantir.0110.t:0 "The Throne in Nilulônde"
 palantir.0110.desc:0 "Beneath the burning sun of [harad|E], surrounded by foes North, South and East, reign the line of Tumakveh. They have strayed from the faith of their ancestors and are beleaguered by their enemies.\n\nCorsairs of [umbar|E] harry their coasts from their northern refuge, the Storm-Host gathers its strength in [anbalkumagan|E] to the South and to the East, rumours of an even greater foe arise."
 palantir.0110.a:0 "They have troubles of their own, they will not help us"
 palantir.0110.a.tt:0 "You gaze into the Palantír again."
 palantir.0110.b:0 "Is there no end to the influence of Sauron?"

 palantir.0111.t:0 "Bloodthirsty Corsairs
 palantir.0111.desc:0 "My vision soars over the bay of Belfalas to the proud port-city of [umbar|E], where stolen gold and jewels shine on the hands of corsair captains. Its shipyards are teeming with workers, building ever greater ships, financed by the riches plundered from the [gondorian|E] coastline.\n\nIts fearsome fleets grow by the day, and soon it will be able to overcome the lands of the [faithfulshort|E] and bleed them dry, preparing the way for the victory of [sauronthedarklordcharacter|E]."
 palantir.0111.a:0 "The strong will be slain, and the weak enslaved!"

 palantir.0110.t:0 "A Shadowed Threat"
 palantir.0110.desc:0 "At last, the ordeal is through, but as your hand moves away from the seeing-stone you feel a great weight fall upon your body, nearly forcing you to your knees. \n\nSo much has become apparent, so many threats finally revealed. No doubt this knowledge will prove useful in the years to come..."
 palantir.0110.a:0 "I need rest..."
