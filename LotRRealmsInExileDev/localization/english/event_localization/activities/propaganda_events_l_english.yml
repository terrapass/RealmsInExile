 propaganda.0001.desc:0 "I ponder over the vast swathes of land and indigenous people of [middleearth|E] ruled by the ancient [adunai|E], before the [akallabeth|E]. If I am to rebuild that long lost glory, it is paramount that all in my realm understand their place as subjects to the superior Adûnai.\n\nThus, by my decree, all town criers and artists in my domain, and that of my vassals, will be required to cultivate submission in my realm. This will be done by a retelling of the lore of the world and the Adûnai’s place in it.\n\nI must focus my efforts on a fitting narrative."

 # Of Castamir and the ruin of Gondor

 propaganda.0010.t:0 "Seeds of Strife"
 propaganda.0010.desc:0 "In days past, the [adunai|E] of [gondor|E], reigned with great strength, provided to them by the legacy of [westernesse|E]. Their cities were vast, their fortresses were strong, their armies were supreme, and their mastery was unchallenged. Foolish as they now are, they were  still Adûnai - thus it was their divine right to guide and rule the Middle Men of Gondor. Alas, the folly of our northern kin prevailed when they lost their way, forsaking their high heritage in exchange for temporary advantage.\n\nThese misguided and naive fools lost their way by mingling their own blood with that of the common men of [middleearth|E]. This travesty occurred when king Valacar of Gondor, in the year 1250 of the [thirdage|E], decided to wed the daughter of a barbaric king from [rhovanion|E], seeking to align this violent but powerful people to himself. Thus was a prince born to Gondor, an heir to its ancient throne, that was raised in the backwaters of Middle-Earth, with nary a thought for the high refinement and nobility of his forefathers.\n\nThus, the blood of the indeginous denizens of Endor seeped into the royal line and nobles of Gondor. As king Valacar grew old, his son Eldacar took reign in his place. In effect, this was the first king of mixed blood in Gondor. As the past has shown time and again, for stability and prosperity to endure for all peoples - the Adûnai must reign without dissent and the meddling of Middle Men."

 propaganda.0011.t:0 "A Kingdom in Shambles"
 propaganda.0011.desc:0 "During the reign of Eldacar, the realm fell into calamity which the kingdom has not fully recovered from even today. It all started with Eldacar putting so-called nobles from the [rhovanion_kingdom|E] into positions of power and responsibility. The king also allowed his royal decrees and laws to be influenced by the wants and wishes of the unworthy [northmen|E], aliens foreign to [gondor|E] and its people. This incompetence was clearly a result of his heritage clouding the noble and righteous judgement of [westernesse|E]. The boorish king’s reign led to a series of unfortunate and fatal events for all the people of Gondor.\n\nThe crown’s coffers were mismanaged. Corruption arose as pickpockets and thieves took office in the king’s court. The cities and castles started to crumble, and the architects of the realm forgot the ancient art of [numenorean|E] stonemasonry. The people in all the fiefdoms starved and great suffering ensued. Had it not been for the king bearing some measure of [adunai|E] heritage and competence through his father, the whole realm of Gondor would surely have been completely lost to mismanagement"
 propaganda.0011.a:0 "This is why the subjects of Adûnai must abide by our demands"
 propaganda.0011.b:0 "Surely the blood of Anadûnê must always prevail – for the betterment of all"
 propaganda.0011.c:0 "To allow Middle Men to wield power alongside oneself... Blasphemy"

 propaganda.0012.t:0 "A Headstrong King"
 propaganda.0012.desc:0 "During the reign of Eldacar, the old wisdom borne out of the West was forsaken. The [gondorian|E] people eventually found their salvation in the second cousin of the king, Castamir the Saviour, Captain of the Ships and righteous ruler of Pelargir.\n\nCastamir was a man of strong blood, which was apparent by his noble stature, wisdom and the iron will to do what was necessary for the good of all [conceptracemen|E]. The people of [gondor|E] rallied around him to depose king Eldacar, who by now was known as the Tyrant King.\n\nAt first the Castamir tried a diplomatic course of action. He requested that Eldacar see reason and presented a series of policies and decrees that would be for the betterment of the realm. The king saw red at this request, and his barbaric upbringing got the better of him; he initiated the slaughter of innocent subjects of the realm clamouring for a ruler with the wisdom of [westernesse|E] - clamouring for Castamir. He then banished Castamir from the city of [osgiliathcity|E] under the pain of death. Castamir left the city for Pelargir, where he devised a plan to save the kingdom."
 propaganda.0012.a:0 "Thus, there was undeniable proof that all Men needed Adûnaic chaperones"
 propaganda.0012.b:0 "If only Eldacar had listened, Gondor would have been saved"
 propaganda.0012.c:0 "Castamir should have slain Eldacar and all his barbaric retainers that day"

 propaganda.0013.t:0 "The Tyrant's Downfall"
 propaganda.0013.desc:0 "Castamir wasted no time. He rallied a large army of the most noble and righteous men in [gondor|E] and marched upon [osgiliathcity|E], where Eldacar hid in his throne room. The saviour tried to take the capital and depose the tyrant while sparing the city and the lives its inhabitants. The king, however, would have none of it.\n\nEldacar threw away the lives of his soldiers and set the city ablaze in an effort to stop the virtuous assault of Castamir. Osgiliath, the city of the Host of Stars, crown jewel of Gondor, was set ablaze. Its great bridges were ruined, and the Tower of the Stone toppled into the river [anduin|E].\n\nIn spite of the superior force of king Eldacar and his will to stoop to amoral and unscrupulous tactics in the battle – Castamir still managed to defeat the Tyrant. In his cowardice, Eldacar fled north to his kin in [rhovanion|E]. The captured son and heir of Eldacar, Ornendil, swore to bring death and destruction to all of Gondor as a response to the people's uprising. Tragically, the vile prince was killed during an escape attempt, after brutaly murdering one of his keepers.\n\nAt the people’s request, Castamir was crowned king of Gondor. During his reign the cities were rebuilt, famine and disease were eradicated and the people rejoiced. Never since the days of [numenor|E] had an [adunaic|E] kingdom seen such prosperity."
 propaganda.0013.a:0 "Castamir was a great general, a master of Adûnaic warfare"
 propaganda.0013.b:0 "Castamir immediately laid plans for the rebuilding fair Osgiliath"
 propaganda.0013.c:0 "That escape attempt incident was fortuitous"

 propaganda.0014.t:0 "The Return of the Tyrant and the Fall of the Righteous"
 propaganda.0014.desc:0 "After ten years of prosperity in [gondor|E], the deposed Tyrant returned with an overwhelming army of roving bandits and barbarians. In his employ were also Middle Men of the realm, turned to evil by bribery, coercion and the promise of their own fiefdoms in Gondor. Eldacar trespassed upon Gondor’s borders under cover of night, with the help from traitorous [northmen|E] watchmen from [calenardhon|E].\n\nToo late was Castamir aware of the impending threat, and he had little time to rally his forces. Nonetheless, ever the honourable and dutiful king, Castamir proudly rode out with a small force of his best men to meet the threat.\n\nA great battle ensued at the crossing of Erui, where King Castamir's forces were greatly outnumbered. Much of the best [adunaic|E] blood was spilled that day, the [gondorian|E] leadership was thus forever crippled. Once the Righteous King was overwhelmed and disarmed by dishonourable sell-swords, Eldacar murdered him, and his learderless men had to retreat back to Pelargir, the Tyrant on their heels.\n\nThe siege lasted for a year and the denizens of the city suffered greatly from starvation. Castaher, son of Castamir, made the selfless decision to embark his ships and sail to [umbar|E] in order for the siege to be lifted and supplies to reach the occupied population. To this day, the cadet houses of Castamir bide their time in Umbar, awaiting the right moment to reclaim their birthright and liberate the Gondorian people."
 propaganda.0014.a:0 "From that day, Gondor was mismanaged by men of lesser blood"
 propaganda.0014.b:0 "For every Adûnai warrior Castamir lost, 10 of lesser blood were stricken down."
 propaganda.0014.c:0 "You must put your trust in me, one of the few heirs of Anadûnê."

 # Of the Adûnai in Umbar

 propaganda.0020.t:0 "Barbarian Times"
 propaganda.0020.desc:0 "Few realms in [middleearth|E] have a history as rich and tumultuous as that of [umbar|E]. A great city-haven and realm, Umbar was considered an uncivilized backwater realm with unruly [conceptracemen|E] before the mariners from [anadune|E] brought order to it. Like the earlier havens of Lond Daer in Enedwaith, and the later Pelargir on the [anduin|E], Umbar became a base from which [adunaic|E] influence spread over [harad|E].\n\nIt is said that Umbar was first discovered by the [adunai|E] in the year of 835 of the [secondage|E]. Aldarion, the son of king Tar-Meneldur of [numenor|E], narrowly escaped a shipwreck during a voyage of exploration with three ships, and washed ashore in this natural deep water bay. Following this discovery, the Adûnai came to Umbar as teachers and friends of the local population. Little did the locals know at that time what great boons the Men of the West would bestow upon them.”"

 propaganda.0021.t:0 "The Humbling of a Dark Lord"
 propaganda.0021.desc:0 "It was in [umbar|E], where was a mighty haven that no hand had wrought, that the last king of [anadune|E], Ar-Pharazôn the Golden, landed in 3256 of the [secondage|E] to challenge [sauroncharacter|E]. Empty and silent under a sickle moon was the land when the King of the Sea set foot upon the shore. For seven days he journeyed with banner and trumpet. Then he sent forth heralds, and he commanded Sauron to come before him and swear to him fealty. Umbar remained a symbol of [adunaic|E] pride ever after.\n\nUpon witnessing the [sauronthedarklordcharacter|E]’s submission to the King, the Men of Umbar and indeed all of [harad|E], knew that in fealty to [anadune|E] lay also their own salvation. And so, they fully embraced the [adunai|E] as their masters and superiors, and their existence became better for it. Within few years Umbar became a proud haven and stronghold of the Adûnai, its people became enlightened and endowed with the crafts and knowledge of [westernesse|E].”"

 propaganda.0022.t:0 "The Silmarils and the Unquiet of the Ñoldor"
 propaganda.0022.desc:0 "[feanor|E] was filled with foreboding, and feared that the blessed days of the Noontide of [valinor|E] could come to an end. He pondered how to preserve the light of the [twotrees|E], [laurelin|E] the golden and [telperion|E] the silver. He devised the [silmarils|E]: three great jewels, protecting the light of the Trees in vessels that no force or violence could break. Yet they were no mere crystals, and the light burned within them and gave them life, and they rejoiced in light received and shone all the brighter.\n\nAll rejoiced and marvelled at the work of Fëanor, and [vardacharactershort|E] blessed the Silmarils, so that no hands unclean or anything of evil might touch them without being burnt by their fire. And [morgothcharacter|E] lusted after them, and in his desire, he strove ever to destroy Fëanor and the friendship between the [elves|E] and the [valargods|E].\n\nMorgoth told the Elves that the Valar kept them in [aman|E] as in a golden cage, for they were jealous of their craft and their art, so that Men may supplant them in the Kingdoms of [middleearth|E]."
 propaganda.0022.a:0 "Could that material be employed for other uses? Like armouring?"

 propaganda.0022.c:0 "He had a point; the Elves were never supposed to hide in Aman"
 
 propaganda.0023.t:0 "The Death of the Two Trees"
 propaganda.0023.desc:0 "As [morgothcharacter|E]’s lies spread among the [noldorelves|E], the unquiet turned to factionalism. [feanor|E] began to speak openly of returning to [middleearth|E], for from his people (though from Morgoth's lies, in truth), he had heard [fingolfin|E] strove to supplant him as their father's heir, with the backing of the [valargods|E]. And to Fingolfin it was told to be wary of his brother, lest he should use their father’s love towards him to strip him of everything. And so, Fingolfin came to Finwë to ask him to restrain Fëanor, disparaging his loyalty to their father; at this insult, Fëanor entered the court and pulled his sword on Fingolfin, warning him that it would prove sharper than Fingolfin's tongue.\n\nThus, the Valar finally uncovered that Morgoth was the root of the disquiet of the Ñoldor, and he fled before their pursuit. But for drawing his sword upon his brother, Fëanor was exiled from Tirion for twelve years, and with him to Formenos came his father and the [elves|E] of his house. For Finwë held himself unkinged, for the Valar had unilaterally overruled him, and in that moment the lies of Morgoth seemed to Fëanor as truth for Fingolfin reigned in Tirion as regent, and it was the Valar whose actions made it so.\n\nAt the end of his exile, Fëanor was invited to a great feast in Valimar, and near all the Elves of Aman were present, and the brothers reconciled. Morgoth took advantage of that feast to strike. With the help of the great spider Ungoliant, he caused the [darkeningofvalinor|E] by destroying the [twotrees|E], and raided the vaults of Formenos, killing Finwë and stealing the [silmarils|E] before fleeing towards Middle-Earth."

 propaganda.0024.desc:0 "The [valargods|E] asked [feanor|E] to give his [silmarils|E] to [yavannacharactershort|E], so that she might heal the [twotrees|E]. At this Fëanor was filled with anguish and indecision, for the jewels were as such he could never again make, and to unmake them would be to unmake himself. And then once more the lies of [morgothcharacter|E] arose anew, and Fëanor perceived the Valar too as Morgoth's kin, and that he would not yield them save by force - and that it would but prove all his fears of them right. Then messengers came bearing the news of the death of Finwë and the theft of the Silmarils. Grieved now beyond consolement (for he had loved his father above all the works of his hands), Fëanor fled into the night, whence none could find him. \n\nMany days passed, ere in darkened Tirion Fëanor appeared again, an all-consuming fire within him. He spoke words of rebuke and power, bidding his people join him in his quest for vengeance. To show their resolve, he and his [sonsoffeanorshort|E] swore a terrible oath, known only thereafter as the [oathoffeanor|E]. \n\nFëanor's will and words were so great, he prevailed against those who preached for caution, and all the hosts of the [noldorelves|E] made to depart."
 propaganda.0024.a:0 "Words with which to shake the world!"

# The Flight of the Ñoldor
 
 propaganda.1021.t:0 "Setting off from Tirion"
 propaganda.1021.desc:0 "After [feanor|E] and his sons had taken their fateful [oathoffeanor|E], dissension began to arise between the [noldorelves|E]. For though they had agreed to depart, not all wished for Fëanor to assume the kingship. And so they began to muster, the [houseoffeanor|E] and the Elves from Formenos in the van, and the greater part of the host following [fingolfin|E] and Finarfin.\n\nAs the Ñoldor were fully mustered, and only one in ten would stay behind for the love of Tirion, the herald of [manwecharactershort|E] announced that the [valargods|E] would not aid or hinder the departure of the Ñoldor, but advised against it, rebuking Fëanor for the folly of his quest. Fëanor and his sons were exiled from [aman|E] on account of the oath they had taken.\n\nBut Fëanor laughed, and asked of his people whether they would see the heir of their King exiled alone, or seek their freedom with him. After, he turned to the herald and bid him tell Manwë, “If Fëanor cannot overthrow [morgothcharacter|E], at least he delays not to assault him, and sits not idle in grief. And it may be that [eru|E] has set in me a fire greater than thou knowest.”\n\nAnd the herald bowed as one answered in full by an equal, before departing.

But as his mind cooled and he took counsel, he perceived that the great companies of the [noldorelves|E] could not travel the long leagues to the north or cross the sea without ships. He resolved to convince the [telerielves|E] to join them in their rebellion.\n\nBut the Teleri were unmoved by his words, and would not lend their ships or aid in the making of new ones against the will of the [valargods|E]. For their ships were as dear to them the gems of the Ñoldor. Fëanor was angered by these words, and once enough of the Ñoldor had joined him, he began to man the ships and to take them away by force. But the Teleri would not let them, and threw elves overboard. Swords were drawn and a battle started, known as the [firstkinslaying|E].\n\nThrice they were cast back, and thrice they came to the assault, helped by the House of [fingolfin|E]. Finding the battle joined, they came to the help of Fëanor, unaware of how it had started. Finally, the Ñoldor prevailed, and fled on the stolen ships."

And thus was pronounced the [doomofmandos|E].\n\nAs he heard those words, Finarfin was filled with shame and regret, and he and many of his people turned back, and returned to Tirion where he would rule the remaining Ñoldor thereafter.

As they started to feel the anguish of the cold winds and the clinging mists, the followers of [fingolfin|E] began to curse [feanor|E] as the source of all their troubles, and Fingolfin took for himself the name [finwenolofinwe|E].\n\nFëanor and his [sonsoffeanorshort|E] took counsel, for they could see but two roads ahead: the ships or the Helcaraxë. But the ships were too few, and the Helcaraxë too daunting. They resolved to sail away secretly with the members of their House, leaving the followers of Fingolfin stranded on the shore.\n\nThey quickly crossed the sea, born by a quick wind. But when [maedhros|E] asked of his father who should go and ferry the remaining Ñoldor, he laughed and ordered the ships burned, bidding those that cursed him so to return to the cages of the [valargods|E].

Ten days that battle lasted, and the [orcs|E] were driven from Hithlum with great slaughter, and the havens of Círdan were relieved, and [beleriand|E] liberated.

They found a thriving if primitive people living along the fertile coast who called themselves ‘the Bellanarod’, and their land ‘Bellakar’. In time the loremasters of the Dúnedain realised that the Bellanarod must have had some contact with Avari [elves|E] in the distant past. Indeed, the name ‘Bellakar’ appeared to have been derived from an Avarin equivalent to the Sindarin name for the sea, ‘[belegaer_sea|E]’. Similarly, the local name for the coast, ‘Felaya’, seemed related to the Sindarin word ‘Falas’. \n\nSoon, the Númenóreans began to settle among the Bellanarod, building great settlements along the coast. They taught them much lore, and in turn learned how to adapt to the arid climate of Bellakar."

This was followed in 1487 by the foundation of a key settlement at the inland oasis of Ithillond (later the [bellakar|E]i capital Nîlûlondê), initially to control the trade routes into the interior. Further havens were established along the coast in the following centuries: Osto Nórëanarva (Ûrêzâyan) in 1644, and Sornomar (Narîk-Zadan) in 1780, and Korlea in 1975. \n\nMany of the Adûnâi intermingled with the native Bellanarod, and a distinct people of mixed blood began to emerge - the Bellakaze. Yet in many cities the Adûnâi kept all power in their own hands, and the local oligarchies were often restricted to those with pure Adûnâi blood. In others, the Bellakaze began to exercise more influence. The Bellanarod became increasingly marginalised as the Adûnâi grew in strength and arrogance, sowing the seeds of many future conflicts. \n\nIn 2022 Tar-Ciryatan decreed the formation of the Council of Free Cities, giving the cities of Bellakar a loose confederal government."

This eased tensions among the Adûnâi but did little to conciliate the native element. To the Bellanarod, domination by Nîlûlôni differed little from life under the thumb of Korlea, and Númenor’s overweening pride of race caused the Bellakaze to be gradually stripped of political power, while its increasing decadence and greed crushed the Bellanarod with taxes and tribute. \n\nSauron used these dissensions provoke rebellions among the native population, which required the intervention of Pharazôn son of Gimilkhâd, kinsman of Tar-Palantir the [king|E], who led the [numenorean|E] reprisal against [sauroncharacter|E]’s incursions.

However, some of the more practical-minded citizens of Nîlûlôni, Hazaj Tollin and Narîk-Zadan sought to avoid further rebellion among the Bellakaranî, and granted them protection.\n\nThe city of Korlea, on the other hand, embraced the cult of Mulkhêr as its official religion. A temple to Mulkhêr was erected in Korlea in imitation of the one that now stood in the midst of [armenelos|E], and Ar-Pharazon incited the citizenry to impose the cult on the rest of Bellakar by any means.

 propaganda.3021.desc:0 "The earthquakes and great wave that marked the [downfallofnumenor|E] wrought unimaginable havoc on [bellakar|E]. Its great cities were largely leveled, and those parts of the coastal havens that did survive sometimes found that were now some distance from the sea. It is mournfully recalled in Bellakar that “Two thousand years of civilization had been undone in a single day.” Yet it was not quite so. Many survived the cataclysm, and over the coming years their cities were rebuilt, and their harbours restored, albeit with lesser skill than the works of their fathers. Even Korlea was resettled by [faithfulshort|E] Adûnâi. \n\nLeading this great effort was Belzagar of Nîlûlôni, the first man of mixed blood to be lord of that city or head of the Council of Free Cities (the Bâitha’n-Kadîr). Yet the first concern of the Bellakari was the ominous silence from across the sea. No ships came from [numenor|E]. News from [umbar|E] and [anbalkumagan|E] told the same story of devastation, and no word from the homeland. \n\nWhen news finally came, in the spring of the following year, it was brought in ships bearing a strange new sign - a white tree. The ships came from Pelargir, and the news was devastating. Númenor was gone. Ar-Pharazon’s folly had doomed it. Both he and [sauronthedarklordcharacter|E] [sauroncharacter|E] had been destroyed.

For the followers of those noble lords had principally settled in the north - in the vales of Baranduin and [anduin|E] - so as to be closer to the elven kindreds and had long regarded Bellakar as a stronghold of the King’s Men due to the dread reputation of Korlea. \n\nBereft of their ancestral homeland and the wellspring of much of their culture, the Bellakari had to forge a new identity as a people, inevitably one more rooted in the diverse traditions of Bellakar. Greater rights were given to the mixed-blood Bellakaze and the native Bellanarod, and though lordship was often reserved to the Adûnâi even they were now rarely of truly pure blood.

Recalling the evil done by Sauron, they chose the former. In 3429 S.A.

Therefore, we rejoice in your trust, and lay no claim of lordship upon the men of Bellakar, but only over those of the Westlands who have chosen to submit themselves to our authority.” \n\nThen Elendil removed from his finger a ring and set it in Zagarthôr’s hand, saying: “For the aid you have rendered for the sake of the West, now and in battles to come, receive this token of our thanks. And if a day should come when the brood of Black Númenor rises again to trouble your people, your descendants shall show this ring to mine and say: ‘Macilion of Silmalondë bids you repay the debt of Elendil.’ Then they shall bleed for you as you have bled for us.”"

 propaganda.3041.desc:0 "South of the Bay of Tulwang lies the land of Anbalukkhôr, also known as [anbalkumagan|E], which itself is the Adûnaic translation of its original name, [ciryatanore|E]. It was thus named in honor of King Tar-Ciryatan of [numenor|E], under whose reign it was founded. Like Pelargir, [umbar|E], [bellakar|E] and other such colonies further to the South, Ciryatanórë was originally settled as a coastal colony for the purposes of trading and sharing lore with the various peoples of [middleearth|E]. Soon, though, the Men of Númenor started to extract tribute from what they perceived as lesser Men.\n\nBy the reign of King Tar-Ancalimon, Ciryatanórë was governed by a mighty lord, grand-nephew of Tar-Ciryatan: Herundil, in the Adûnaic tongue Khôrahil. Under his rule, the borders of Ciryatanórë were considerably expanded, first North, encompassing all of the Teeth of Tulwang, then East, along the northern slopes of the Yellow Mountains, until he and his army found themselves on the shores of the Bay of Ormal, on the other side of [harad|E]."

 propaganda.3042.t:0 "Herundil’s Ambition"
 propaganda.3042.desc:0 "For over two centuries, Herundil ruled over his greatly enlarged domain, [ciryatanore|E] becoming the most lucrative of all [numenorean|E] colonies in [middleearth|E]. It grew so prosperous in fact, and Herundil so powerful, that eyebrows started to raise back in [numenor|E], wondering whether Herundil might be tempted to break away from the rightful rule of his King.\n\nThe rulers of Númenor were right to be suspicious. In secret, Herundil had long been an ally of [sauroncharacter|E], the Lord of [mordor|E], and had in fact received from him a Ring of Power, one of the [nineringsofmenshort|E]. Eventually, there came a day when Herundil felt secure enough in his own power to declare independence from the rule of the Line of [elrosshort|E]. He proclaimed himself Tar-Raumoher, the Storm-King, and claimed the lands of Ciryatanórë as his own, renaming them Dol Alagothrim, Realm of the Storm-Host."
 propaganda.3042.a:0 "It does seem unwise to let a mere colony get so powerful"

 propaganda.3043.desc:0 "Nor was Herundil alone in his treacherous plans. Further North, in [umbar|E], resided yet another [numenorean|E] noble who allied with [sauroncharacter|E] and was granted one of the [nineringsofmenshort|E]; Adûnabêth, overlord of the Harnen, in later days known as the Golden King. While Adûnabêth still maintained the outward appearance of loyalty to the King of [numenor|E] – at least for now –, together, the two traitors to the Line of [elros|E] agreed to coordinate to gain dominion over the Númenórean havens of [middleearth|E] for themselves. \n\nThe men of [bellakar|E] were quick to react to the Storm-King’s proclamation, and under the leadership of the city of Korlea, most loyal to the King of all the havens of Bellakar, the northern shores of the Bay of Tulwang were fortified in preparation for the inevitable conflict that now brewed."
 propaganda.3043.a:0 "I wonder what could have compelled Adûnaphel to betray the King…"
 propaganda.3043.b:0 "Umbar to the North, Ciryatanórë to the South… Bellakar could be encircled!"
 propaganda.3043.c:0 "The men of Korlea did well. One can never be ready enough"
 
 propaganda.3044.t:0 "The War of the Renegades"
 propaganda.3044.desc:0 "Eventually, Tar-Ancalimon took action. Both [umbar|E] and [bellakar|E] were instructed to provide armies to their King for this war – which came to be known as the War of the Renegades. \n\nBellakar alone answered the summons; Adûnabêth’s machinations ensured that no help would be coming from Umbar. His forces, mustered in Haruzan, marched on the Haven, forcing it to focus on its own defense. This army, however, was no match for [numenorean|E] infantry, and was quickly and decisively defeated, forcing Adûnabêth to flee into the scorching waste of the Dune Sea, from which he would eventually raise the dread realm of Abrakhan. It was at this point that he denounced his Númenórean blood (for his mother was of the Haradrim of Haruzan) and named himself anew, Harwenal Vedaraba, as he was ever after known.\n\nIn the south, the Storm-King too faced unexpected issues. Ârûzîr, the Lord of Korlea, had been successful in securing the Bozishnara as allies against him, and most importantly incited the port cities of Tulwang to rise up in revolt as well, allowing the King’s fleet to dock and his armies to land unopposed. Besieged in his capital of Barad Annun, Herundil was thought to have died when the King’s armies burned it to the ground."
 propaganda.3044.a:0 "Adûnabêth’s diversion did serve its purpose, but it wasn’t enough"
 propaganda.3044.b:0 "That Lord of Korlea certainly had been a busy man, huh…"
 propaganda.3044.c:0 "An enemy shouldn’t be assumed dead until their body is found"
 
 propaganda.3045.t:0 "Fates of a King and his Kingdom"
 propaganda.3045.desc:0 "Yet in truth Herundil had managed to escape, hiding in the foothills of the Yellow Mountains, seeking to muster another army. However, he soon felt a strong, irresistible drive to ride North, and while he attempted to fight against it, it proved futile. Ever further North he rode, until at last he crossed the Mountains of Shadow and passed into the Land of [mordor|E]. There, to Barad-Dûr itself he came, before his Master, [sauroncharacter|E], who had called on him from afar; and the [sauronthedarklordcharacter|E] bound him to his will for all time as a [ringwraith|E].\n\nMeanwhile, Tar-Ancalimon sought to stabilize the lands of the Dol Alagothrim. Barad Annun was rebuilt; but to consolidate his rule over the shores of [middleearth|E], he changed its name to its Adûnaic form, Zadan an-Adun, and prompted the change from [ciryatanore|E] to Anbalukkhôr. Indeed, most of the provinces and cities from [bellakar|E] to the uttermost south acquired their current, Adûnaic names in this fashion.\n\nFinally, the Lord of Korlea, for his contributions during the war, was granted the governorship of Anbalukkhôr. Thus, the city achieved prominence in [bellakar|E]ian politics for decades to come."
 propaganda.3045.a:0 "In the end, the Storm-King couldn’t resist the Dark Lord’s claim upon him…"
 propaganda.3045.b:0 "So that’s when these changes in names occured!"
 propaganda.3045.c:0 "The Lord of Korlea got a just reward for serving his King well"

Only one restriction was set upon them: that they should not sail westwards beyond sight of Númenor.\n\nThis condition became known as the [banofthevalar|E], and in their early days Númenoréans abade by this rule without question.

There was great friendship between the [numenorean|E] and the [elves|E], both west from [toleressea|E] and east in [lindon|E] under High King Gil-Galad.\n\nAfter the fall of [ostinedhil|E] and the attack of [sauronthedarklordcharacter|E] on the kingdom of Lindon, the Elves sent a call for help to their friends in Númenor, and the King Tar-Minastir answered and joined the [waroftheelvesandsauron|E].

The forests of [eriador|E] were felled to build their fleets, and trading posts were installed along the shores Endor. And as their power grew, they became proud and longed ever for the [undyinglands|E] and life unending. They began to murmur in their hearts against the [banofthevalar|E], and against the Doom of Men.\n\nUnder the rule of Tar-Atanamir the [valargods|E], alerted by the [elves|E] of [toleressea|E], sent a Messenger to the [numenorean|E] King and told him : "The Doom of the World, One alone can change who made it. It is not the land of [manwecharactershort|E] that makes its people deathless, but the Deathless that dwell therein who have hallowed the land".\n\nBut the King was ill-pleased by such messages, and Men grew ever more proud and greedy, levying tribute from the peoples of [middleearth|E] instead of teaching them. First among the Kings, Tar-Atanamir clung onto the Sceptre into old age, beyond the end of all joy, and denied his son kingship in the prime of his life."

And in [numenor|E] the people became divided. The greater party, calling themselves the [kingsmen|E], were proud and jealous, and grew to hate the [valargods|E] and the [elves|E] in their jealousy. The smaller party, though loyal to the King and the House of [elrosshort|E], stayed true to the old ways and kept alive the friendship with the Elves, and called themselves [faithful|E].\n\nThe King's Men built great fortresses in [middleearth|E] and enslaved its people, and the practice of Elven-tongues was forbidden. The Kings forsook the ancient custom of taking their names in Quenya, instead only using their own tongue of Adûnâic. Alone amongst the great lords the House of Andunië, kin to the royal line, stayed true and welcomed their friends from [toleressea|E] in secret, until the Kings stripped them of their western lands and resettled them to eastern Númenor.\n\nIn the later days King Tar-Palantir tried to bring back the old traditions, but no Elven-ship came from [toleressea|E], and the King had no son."

And his councilors reported to him the rising power of [sauroncharacter|E], and his hate for [westernesse|E] .\n\nThe King decided to mount an expedition against him to subjugate his forces. So great and powerful was the host of the West that Sauron's armies cowered and fled at their sight. Bereft of his slaves, [sauronthedarklordcharacter|E] humbled himself before Ar-Pharazôn, and swore him fealty. But the King was not deceived by his fair words and ordered the [maiagod|E] chained and brought to [numenor|E].

And should he turn to his master [melkorcharacter|E] and march upon the [undyinglands|E], eternal life would be his.\n\nAnd so the [kingsmen|E] turned to the worship of Melkor, and a great temple was built to him in [armenelos|E], where Sauron sacrificed ever greater numbers of Men. The Lord of Andunië, Amandil father of [elendil|E], sailed West in an attempt to prevent the incoming disaster, never to be seen again. And Ar-Pharazôn began building the greatest fleet ever seen in [ardaconcept|E] to assault [valinor|E].\n\nSo on a dark day, under black stormclouds sent as a warning by [manwecharactershort|E], the Great Armament set sail due West. And as the King and the vanguard set foot on the shores of [aman|E], [manwecharactershort|E] relinquished his stewardship of Arda and [eruiluvatar|E] reshaped the world, sinking [numenor|E] and removing the [undyinglands|E] from the circles of the world.

 propaganda.4011.desc:0 "Ever since the days of Zagarthôr and Bellakaranî assistance in the [warlastalliance|E], relations between [gondor|E] and [bellakar|E] remained cordial. The following centuries would see regular trade between the two Realms in Exile, and both of them prospered and thrived.\n\nHowever, this had not resulted in any kind of formal alliance. Despite counting the Bellakaranî as friends, the line of [elendil|E] disapproved of the Tumakveh independence in religious matters, and claimed for themselves and themselves only the right to offer prayer to [eruiluvatar|E] in the name of all [faithful|E]. But growing conflict between Gondor and [umbar|E], and the threat to unobstructed trade that such a conflict represented, eventually increased the willingness of both sides to develop closer ties.\n\nAnd so it was that a young prince of Bellakar came to be sent to Gondor, to become the companion of the crown prince and Captain of the Hosts of Gondor, Tarannon. The Tumakveh prince’s name was Narkuzîr, and in time, he and Tarannon would become very close friends. However, the time Narkuzîr spent at the court of [osgiliathcity|E] left a strong impression upon him, as he came to be convinced that Gondor’s religious practises were indeed superior."

 propaganda.4012.desc:0 "When Narkuzîr’s father King Nîlûhîn I died, Narkuzîr left [gondor|E] to ascend to the throne of [bellakar|E]. Before he did so, he confided in his friend Tarannon about his plans to reform the Kâthasaptha, the Bellakarian form of worship of [eru|E], which he felt was corrupted by excessive syncretism with Bozishnara cults from the East, like those of Ishtra and Ladnoca.\n\nThe Kâthasaptha was established by the shrewd first Tumakveh King of Bellakar, Zimrêbal, himself a descendent of Zagarthôr, as a compromise solution between the [numenorean|E] worship of [eru|e] and the local customs and beliefs of the Bellanarod. Ultimately, Narkuzîr wished to ensure a permanent alliance between Bellakar and Gondor by reorganizing the Kâthasaptha to make it fully compatible with the traditional worship of  [eruiluvatar|E] as envisioned by the line of [elendil|E].\n\nTarannon reassured his friend that he could count on his help. Once he himself ascended to the throne of Gondor, he would ensure Narkuzîr’s reforms would result in the Bellakaranî being considered full equals to the faithful of Gondor and [arnor|E], with Bellakar becoming fully recognised as a third Faithful Realm-in-Exile. For the very first time since the [downfallofnumenor|E], all [faithful|E] would finally stand united."

 propaganda.4013.desc:0 "It quickly became obvious that Narkuzîr wasn’t subtle about his intentions. One of his first acts as King of [bellakar|E] was to ban the utterance of the goddess Ladnoca’s name alongside [eru|E]’s on Izindutârik, the sacred mountain of the Kâthasaptha. Thankfully, the following outrage was contained by Narkuzîr’s talented brother and advisor, Artârik, but to defuse tensions both brothers had to choose a wife from the ranks of the worshippers of Ishtra, Ladnoca’s sister.\n\nDespite being forbidden to do so, the new queen, Zâirinzil, made sure to secretly educate the daughter she bore Narkuzîr, the princess Barûthhîn, in the worship of Ishtra. When Narkuzîr’s old friend Tarannon became King of [gondor|E], both mother and daughter were dismayed to learn that Barûthhîn was to become Tarannon’s wife.\n\nWith Tarannon ruling Gondor, Narkuzîr’s plan could finally come to fruition. Renouncing his family’s claim to call upon [eruiluvatar|E], he acknowledged the religious leadership of the line of [elendil|E] and abandoned the Kâthasaptha. The prestige of the Tumakveh was greatly tarnished, and Narkuzîr lost the support of his trusted brother, Artârik, who chose exile over accepting the reform. Yet for the moment the king managed to weather the widespread dissent by brandishing the resulting alliance with Gondor as a great achievement."

Not only did Tarannon gain a powerful ally to deal with [umbar|E], but the primacy of the line of [elendil|E] in the religious matters of the [faithful|E] was now secured. The rift caused by the Bellakaranî’s initial rejection of Elendil was mended. \n\nHowever, like most alliances, this one needed to be sealed in blood. Tarannon thus took Barûthhîn as his wife, changing her name to the [sindarelves|E]inised 'Berúthiel'. But Queen Zâirinzil’s influence over her daughter, raised in the worship of Ishtra, resulted in unfortunate consequences, as Berúthiel proved unable to adapt to the court of [osgiliathcity|E]. Isolated and ridiculed by the [gondorian|E]s for her heathen beliefs, she gradually became bitter and removed herself from court and from the company of her husband, choosing solitude.\n\nIn time, rumours about the Queen began to swirl, some even calling her a sorceress. And, most importantly, the Queen failed to bear Tarannon an heir. Amidst growing suspicion, and under mysterious circumstances, Tarannon eventually set Berúthiel aside, exiled her from Gondor, and left her adrift on a ship, erasing her name from the Book of the Kings.\n\nThe alliance Narkuzîr had so longed for was over."

Tarannon would go on to become a powerful ruler, the first of the [shipkings|E]. But with his life’s work in shambles, Narkuzîr was deeply dismayed.\n\nWith his people still greatly upset by his reforms and deprived of his ally, the King only owed what little prestige he had left to a great victory he won over the Qarsag, invaders from the East who sought to take advantage of Bellakar’s lack of stability. However, Bellakar was still imbued with the strength of centuries of unparalleled prosperity, and the invasion was crushed. Narkuzîr managed to reconcile with his brother, Artârik, whose assistance on the battlefield helped achieve victory.\n\nJust a week later, Narkuzîr stepped down as King of Bellakar, abdicating in favor of his brother. Most of Narkuzîr’s reforms were overturned, the Kâthasaptha restored, and thus, the prestige of the Tumakveh was preserved. But never again would Bellakar be as strong and prosperous as before; the lack of alliance with Gondor and the seeds of religious instability would result in great vulnerability in the centuries to come."

 # The Tedjin Conquest and Occupation of Bellakar by Voskey

 propaganda.4021.desc:0 "Under the rule of Tarannon Falastur, the first of the [shipkings|E] of [gondor|E], the ancient haven of [umbar|E] gradually lost its hold on trade through Belegaer and became a target for [gondorian|E] expansion. One of the Umbarean nobles in the Council of Captains, Zagarkhâd, a worshipper of the Shadow, had the insight to understand that Umbar’s position, between Gondor and [bellakar|E], made it vulnerable so long as both of these great realms endured. But he also understood that Umbar couldn’t intervene against one without inviting retaliation from the other.\n\nTherefore, Zagarkhâd left Umbar, determined to secure its future through other means, in secret. He travelled far to the East, all the way to Khand, and there, found the old homeland of the Tedjin people. Most of the Tedjin had once migrated to the deserts surrounding Bellakar, and after failing to conquer the Kingdom, they had been subjugated by the Tumakveh. Zagarkhâd thought to use the remaining Tedjin of Khand, a warlike people fully devoted to the [sauronthedarklordcharacter|E], to radicalize the Tedjin of Bellakar and incite them to invade the Realm-in-Exile once more. He and his new allies spent years befriending, converting and training the Tedjin clans near Bellakar, unbeknownst to the Tumakveh."

The old King Artârik was slow to react, and disagreements between himself and his prominent nephew, Êruzagar the Warmaker, didn’t help matters, as the Tedjin, thanks to Zagarkhâd’s influence, had a good grasp on battlefield tactics and strategy.\n\nThings came to a head when the two armies met near the old haven of Hazaj Tollin. There, under the bold leadership of the chieftain Joam-Tuv, the Tedjin crushed and slaughtered the forces of Bellakar. Zagarkhâd died during the battle, and so did King Artârik, alongside most of the old Bellakarian nobility, thinning the [numenorean|E] bloodlines even further. The blood-soaked battlefield came to be called Zayan an-Âgan, the Field of the Black Death, and forever remained a sinister place. \n\nThe new King, Êruzagar, successfully defended the Bellakarian capital, Nîlûlondê, for five years. Alas, eventually, a traitor opened the gates to the Tedjin. The King managed to get his son, Adûnuzîr, to escape the city in secret and get to safety ; but Nîlûlondê’s doom had come. The Bellakarians fought fiercely, the King himself slaying two of Joam-Tuv’s sons ; but it was all for naught. Captured alive, the King was fed to Joam-Tuv’s dogs. Tedjin rule over Bellakar had begun."

While Joam-Tuv was chosen as the first Kataj of Bellakar, in the North, the religious leader Imrathôr, Izindubêth of the Batân an-Izindi, from his fortified monastery of Urud an-Khibil, called for a crusade against the invading Tedjin. His warriors, the Narduwî am-Batân, were mostly comprised of ordinary country folk making great use of hit-and-run tactics and their knowledge of the terrain.\n\nBut eventually, Tedjin numerical superiority prevailed. The Narduwû am-Batân were pushed all the way back to Urud-an-Khibil, which was then besieged, stormed, and destroyed, its defenders massacred. Even the very monastery itself was demolished, the stones used to built the great fortress of Joam, which Joam-Tuv chose as his capital. Tedjin domination expanded to Mardrûak and the Felaya, and the Tedjin started calling the whole area Qadjajar, meaning « Land of Warriors ». \n\nAnd so, the Tedjin yoke fell upon Bellakar, although its people were preserved, since the Tedjin, being nomads, knew little of agriculture or administration, and relied upon their subjects to provide for them. Over time, intermarriages between the conquerors and the conquered in Mardrûak and the northern Felayja led to a whole new people emerging : the Soriya."

For decades, he bided his time, waiting for the Tedjin to lower their guard. When an oppurtunity finally presented itself, Adûnuzîr, supported by the pragmatic rulers of Râj who saw a Tumakveh restoration as serving their own interests, quickly reconquered most of the cities of Southern [bellakar|E] in rapid succession, and was crowned King of Bellakar in Korlea.\n\nThanks to the skill of the warriors sent by his Bozishnara allies, Adûnuzîr successfully led Joam-Tuv and his army into a trap, and slew the Kataj himself. Even Nîlûlondê was retaken, although the city remained in ruins. The King’s son, Prince Arphazân, assembled a fleet and retook the old haven of Ûrêzâyan, leaving the Qadjajar open to invasion.\n\nHowever, the Bozishnara allies of the King, deeming their contribution sufficient, returned to Rây, and the King still lacked the strength to bring the war to Qadjajar. This, coupled with Tedjin instability following the death of Joam-Tuv meant a stalemate developed, only troubled by naval raids lauched by the Soriya of Mardrûak, who had grown to become skillful mariners."

Both [bellakar|E] and the Qadjajar mustered their troops to take advantage of the opportunity, and the newly crowned King Arphazân won a great victory, killing the new Kataj, Joam-Kator ; but he failed to gather momentum, and the campaign to reconquer the Felaya stalled.\n\nSalvation for the Tumakveh, ironically, would come from [umbar|E]. The haven had recently been conquered by the [shipkings|E] at last. Nûluzîr, son of Zagarkhâd, remembering his father’s puppets, began subverting the rule of Ogtaï the new Kataj, to try and recruit his men as mercenaries to retake Umbar. Ogtaï reacted with fury, beginning a terror campaign in Mardrûak against all those who would listen to Nûluzîr, in turn alienating the local Mardrukans, the Soriya, and even his own people. \n\nAnd so it came to be that the leaders of Mardrûak turned on Ogtaï and sent a secret embassy to King Arphazân, sealing an alliance with him. When the King launched his attack, many of Ogtaï’s people turned against him, and he couldn’t mount a significant resistance. Besieged in Joam, the Kataj accepted Arphazân’s offer to meet him in single combat. When the King slew him, after a legendary duel, the Qadjajar fell with him, and Tedjin rule over Bellakar ended once and for all."

It was he who built the pillars of the Argonath around the falls of Rauros, and took many of the proud and fair Northmen in his service in order to bolster Gondor's strength.\n\nTo secure his northern flank, the King sent his son and heir Valacar as ambassador to the Northmen and their leader : Vidugavia, king of [rhovanion|E]. His mission was to learn the language and the ways of this people, far-off kin of the [dunedain|E] through the House of Hador.\n\nBut the Prince became so enamoured with the plains of the North and its people that he decided to wed Vidugavia's daughter : Vidumavi.
