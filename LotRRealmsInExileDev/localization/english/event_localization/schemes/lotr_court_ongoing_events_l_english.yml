 court_ongoing.2001.spring_opening:0 "Today marks the opening of the Festival of Nost-na-Lothion, the Birth of Flowers, when Arien once again brings the warmth of Anor to Middle-Earth. As Elf-children dance in circles with flowers in their hair, we celebrate the return of [yavannacharacter|E]'s blessing."
 court_ongoing.2001.summer_opening:0 "Today marks the opening of the Festival of Tarnin Austa, the Gates of Summer, when Arien sails Anor close to Middle-Earth and dispels [morgothcharacter|E]'s cold from the lands. We wait eagerly for the coming dawn to sing our welcome to the new season."
 court_ongoing.2001.autumn_opening:0 "Today marks the opening of the Festival of Yáviérë, the Gift of Fruits, when the leaves fall and the fruits are ripe in the trees. The banquet tables are heavy with magnificent fruits and the best venison."
 court_ongoing.2001.winter_opening:0 "Today marks the opening of the Festival of Turuhalmë, the Logdrawing, when the snows are heavy and the fireplaces hunger for wood. The fires are raging in the halls, and the bards are ready to sing their stories."
 court_ongoing.2001.distant_opening:1 "I have made my way to the court in [court_of_residence.GetNameNoTier] in time for the festival at the [court_owner.Custom('ResidenceBuilding')]. I secured an invitation, for I have to see [target.GetTitledFirstName]."
 court_ongoing.2001.close_opening:1 "I am attending the festival not simply because I am the [ROOT.Char.GetLadyLord|U] of the [court_owner.Custom('ResidenceBuilding')], but because I want to see [target.GetTitledFirstName] there."
 court_ongoing.2001.desc:1 "\n\n[target.GetSheHe|U] looks resplendent. As the music starts, signaling the first dance, my gaze meets [target.GetHersHis] and soon our hands meet and we dance with abandon, oblivious to our surroundings.\n\n When the music subsides and when we finally have a quiet moment, I offer my suggestion."
 court_ongoing.2001.a:0 "Join me in the circle for the next dance, my [target.GetLadyLord]?"
 court_ongoing.2001.a.tt:0 "#F Appeal to [target.GetFirstNamePossessiveNoTooltip] playful side.#!"
 court_ongoing.2001.b:0 "A walk in the garden, away from all of this?"
 court_ongoing.2001.b.tt:0 "#F Appeal to [target.GetFirstNamePossessiveNoTooltip] thoughtful side.#!"
 court_ongoing.2001.c:0 "Could I provide you with some more food?"
 court_ongoing.2001.c.tt:0 "#F Appeal to [target.GetFirstNamePossessiveNoTooltip] greedy side.#!"

 court_ongoing.2003.opening:0 "At the [court_owner.Custom('ResidenceBuilding')] dance [owner.GetTitledFirstName] came to me, offering [owner.GetHerHis] company."
 court_ongoing.2003.dance:0 "\n\nAs we spun on the floor we certainly turned some heads, and I was laughing like a little [ROOT.Char.Custom('GirlBoy')]!"
 court_ongoing.2003.walk:0 "\n\nWe walked in the garden, talking about all manner of things until we realized we had both lost track of time!"
 court_ongoing.2003.food:0 "\n\n[owner.GetSheHe|U] had some servants bring out a few more dishes, and we sat eating together for most of the night. It was delicious!"
 court_ongoing.2003.mockery:0 "\n\nWe sat making fun of the other guests, sharing jokes and laughter. I am thoroughly impressed with [owner.GetFirstNamePossessiveNoTooltip] incisive wit!"
 court_ongoing.2003.fallback:0 "\n\nWe ended up having so much fun, we danced almost the entire duration of the celebration!"
 court_ongoing.2003.a:0 "I had such a good evening!"

 court_ongoing.2004.dance:0 "[owner.GetSheHe|U] failed to take the hint that I was not interested in dancing, and after a few reluctant spins I had to ask [owner.GetHerHim] to let me go."
 court_ongoing.2004.walk:0 "While a walk in the garden was bracing, [owner.GetFirstNamePossessive] chatter bored me immensely.\n\nI soon made my excuses, and found my way back to the dance."
 court_ongoing.2004.food:0 "While I was not opposed to [owner.GetHerHis] presence, the entire evening [owner.GetSheHe] sent servants for more and more dishes of food. I was quickly full, and made my excuses to go dancing instead."
 court_ongoing.2004.mockery:0 "[target.GetSheHe|U] sat next to me, making comments about the other guests.\n\nNot only was it needlessly cruel, but crude and completely artless as well."
 court_ongoing.2004.fallback:0 "[owner.GetSheHe|U] kept suggesting ways of spending time at the celebrations, but there is only so much [owner.GetSheHe] can do when [owner.GetSheHe] is such dreadful company by [owner.GetHerselfHimself]."
 court_ongoing.2004.a:0 "What was [owner.GetSheHe] thinking?"

 court_ongoing.2005.dance:0 "[target.GetTitledFirstName] and I spun across the floor together, turning heads as [target.GetSheHe] laughed to [target.GetHerHis] heart's content."
 court_ongoing.2005.walk:0 "[target.GetTitledFirstName] and I walked gardens, talking about all manner of things. We eventually realized we had both lost track of time, and when we returned the dance had already started winding down."
 court_ongoing.2005.food:0 "I had the servants bring more food for [target.GetTitledFirstName] and myself, and as the evening went by we delighted in every delicious dish that the cooks of [court_of_residence.GetNameNoTier] have to offer. That [target.GetWomanMan] certainly has a taste for the finer things in life."
 court_ongoing.2005.mockery:0 "We sat together, making one joke after another about the other guests. I had not expected [target.GetTitledFirstName] to be quite so skilled in the art of mockery!"
 court_ongoing.2005.fallback:0 "[target.GetTitledFirstName] and I ended up having so much fun, we danced almost the entire duration of the celebration!"
 court_ongoing.2005.a:0 "What an evening we had!"

 court_ongoing.2006.dance:0 "I thought I was set once [target.GetSheHe] agreed to dance, but even though I handled myself deftly, [target.GetTitledFirstName] soon made some excuses and left me standing by myself among the other dancers."
 court_ongoing.2006.walk:0 "I thought it a pleasant walk, but perhaps it was too cold, or perhaps I spoke too much, for [target.GetSheHe] soon made [target.GetHerHis] excuses and returned to the dance, not even waiting to see if I was coming along.\n\nBy the time I made it back, [target.GetSheHe] was busy having fun with the other dancers."
 court_ongoing.2006.food:0 "Perhaps there was something wrong with the food I had the servants bring out for [target.GetTitledFirstName]? Even after [target.GetSheHe] had made [target.GetHerHis] excuses the food kept streaming in from the kitchen, piling up as I sat picking at it alone."
 court_ongoing.2006.mockery:0 "No matter how hard I tried, [target.GetTitledFirstName] did not laugh at my jokes. In the end [target.GetSheHe] accused me of being pointlessly cruel, and left me sitting by myself."
 court_ongoing.2006.fallback:0 "I kept suggesting ways we could spend time at the celebrations, but [target.GetTitledFirstName] seemed completely uninterested. Did I do something wrong?"
 court_ongoing.2006.a:0 "This went poorly."
