 ### A Colossal Wreck ###
 lotr_travel_events.0001.t:0 "$travel_event_prefix$ A Colossal Wreck"
 lotr_travel_events.0001.desc:0 "As we make our way through the [ROOT.Char.GetCurrentLocation.GetTerrain.GetNameNoTooltip|l] of [ROOT.Char.GetCurrentLocation.GetNameNoTooltip], I find myself falling behind the rest of the group. After some time, I eventually come across a colossal wreck - Two vast and trunkless legs of stone stand on a pedestal in the desert.\nNear them, on the sand, half sunk, a shattered visage lies. On the pedestal, these words appear:\n\n#V "MY NAME IS AR-ZÎMANDÂS, KING OF KINGS: LOOK ON MY WORKS, YE MIGHTY, AND DESPAIR!"#!\n\nNothing else remains beside that colossal wreck. The lone and level sands stretch far away."

 lotr_travel_events.0002.t:0 "$travel_danger_prefix$ Giant Scorpion Attack"
 lotr_travel_events.0002.desc:0 "Dawn is setting as we make our way through the seemingly endless Dune Sea. Suddendly, I notice the sands beginning to shift a short distance to my left. A smooth, black shell appears, then three pairs of burning red eyes. Two giant pincers and a deadly stinger, large enough to impale a man, arise from the dunes.\n\nJust as I and my companions spring back, a giant scorpion emerges from its hiding spot, raising its claws and chittering angrily. My companions are terrified, why did we choose this path!?"
 lotr_travel_events.0002.desc.again:0 "The sun is still high in the sky as we continue to make our way through the seemingly endless Dune Sea. Suddendly, I notice the sands beginning to shift a short distance to my right, with some now oh-so familiar chittering sounds.\n\nThis time, three giant scorpions burst from the sands, giant pincers clacking and with deadly stingers large enough to impale a man. These things must really hold a grudge!"

 ### Sandstorm! ###
 lotr_travel_events.0003.t:1 "$travel_danger_prefix$ Sandstorm!"
 lotr_travel_events.0003.desc:0 "As we make our way through the endless ocean of sand, dubbed the "Mirror of Fire" by the locals, we see something strange on the horizon: A great wall seems to stretch across the entire horizon in front of us. No, not a wall... a storm!\n\nPanic breaks out among my people, as we begin to hastily set camp - The Dune Sea is feared for its deathly dust storms known as the 'Breath of Sanbaiz'. I fear I shall not live to see another day if I try to survive on luck alone."
 lotr_travel_events.0003.a:0 "Our guide is organizing our camp! I will be fine."
