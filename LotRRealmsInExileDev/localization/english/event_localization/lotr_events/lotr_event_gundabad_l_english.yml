 gundabad.0200.desc:0 "For far too long, the Orcs of the North have forgotten their past. They wander about not different with wild dogs, only to be helplessly slaughtered by the men that have grown in strength since the mishap at Dale! Guided by the great Ulûkai and the blood of Azog that grants [ROOT.Char.GetHerHim] great power and wit so desperately needed, [ROOT.Char.GetFirstNameRegnal] has once again cemented Orcish supremacy in the Anduin Vale.\n\nNow that we finally established secure control over the various bridges and fords across the Anduin, the wrath of Mount Gundabad will be felt by all throughout the North. Already warg riders are scouting for potential targets. May our raids swiftly befall any who dare to oppose us, men or elves!"
 gundabad.0200.a:0 "Great terror shall ride forth from Gundabad once more!"
