 # Introduction Events
 dwarven.0100.t:0 "The King Beneath the Mountain"
 dwarven.0100.desc:0 "Dain II Ironfoot, King Under the Mountain and the Lord of the Iron Hills has ruled these golden halls for nigh sixty years, sixty years of peace and prosperity for all dwarvendom following the Battle of the Five Armies, the defeat of Smaug the Terrible and the tragic deaths of Thorin Oakenshield and his sister-sons.\n\nWith Erebor mostly rebuilt from the ravages of the Dragon, the dwarves look once more beyond their borders to restore the ancient friendships with the Men of Dale and the Elves of the Greenwood, ever keeping a watchful eye to the Northern Wastes, lest any fire-drakes still living surprise them once more."
 dwarven.0100.a:0 "Through Dragon-fire and war, these halls endure all"
 
 dwarven.0200.t:0 "The Lord of Moria"
 dwarven.0200.desc:0 "Balin of the Company of Thorin Oakenshield has set out on a grand quest once more - to reclaim the ancient Dwarven capital of Khazad-Dûm from the orcish stragglers that crawled out of their caverns once more after the fateful Battle of Azanulbizar.\n\nSetting forth from Erebor with a great company of dwarves against the wishes of King Dain, Balin travelled south and then West along the Old Forest Road passing through danger and strife beneath the boughs of Mirkwood before finally emerging and facing a fierce fight to gain entry to Khazad-Dûm.\n\nThe Company may be diminished, but our valour and ambition are not!"
 dwarven.0200.a:0 "We have taken the Twenty-first Hall..."
 
 dwarven.0300.t:0 "The Lord of Nordinbad"
 dwarven.0300.desc:0 "Ever since the days of Gorin's great-grandsire, dwarves have dwelled in Nordinbad. Though the hold was never rich in terms of gold and silver, of iron it has plenty and its beauty is worth more than any mountain of gold, carefully nurtured and enhanced by the faithful dwarves.\n\nWhile many other dwarf-holds in the Grey Mountains were consumed in Dragon-fire, the lack of conventional wealth steered the devastation away from Nordinbad's peaceful halls, and the Lords therein offered shelter to many survivors, for a time."
 dwarven.0300.a:0 "The beauty of Azan-zâram shall endure"
