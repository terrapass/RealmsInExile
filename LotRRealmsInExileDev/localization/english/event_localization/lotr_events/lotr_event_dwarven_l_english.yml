 ### Introduction Events
 dwarven.0100.t:0 "The King Beneath the Mountain"
 dwarven.0100.desc:0 "Dain II Ironfoot, King Under the Mountain and the Lord of the Iron Hills has ruled these golden halls for nigh sixty years, sixty years of peace and prosperity for all dwarvendom following the Battle of the Five Armies, the defeat of Smaug the Terrible and the tragic deaths of Thorin Oakenshield and his sister-sons.\n\nWith Erebor mostly rebuilt from the ravages of the Dragon, the dwarves look once more beyond their borders to restore the ancient friendships with the Men of Dale and the Elves of the Greenwood, ever keeping a watchful eye to the Northern Wastes, lest any fire-drakes still living surprise them once more."
 dwarven.0100.a:0 "Through Dragon-fire and war, these halls endure all"
 
 dwarven.0200.t:0 "The Lord of Moria"
 dwarven.0200.desc:0 "Balin of the Company of Thorin Oakenshield has set out on a grand quest once more - to reclaim the ancient Dwarven capital of Khazad-Dûm from the orcish stragglers that crawled out of their caverns once more after the fateful Battle of Azanulbizar.\n\nSetting forth from Erebor with a great company of dwarves against the wishes of King Dain, Balin travelled south and then West along the Old Forest Road passing through danger and strife beneath the boughs of Mirkwood before finally emerging and facing a fierce fight to gain entry to Khazad-Dûm.\n\nThe Company may be diminished, but our valour and ambition are not!"
 dwarven.0200.a:0 "We have taken the Twenty-first Hall..."
 
 dwarven.0300.t:0 "The Lord of Nordinbad"
 dwarven.0300.desc:0 "Ever since the days of Gorin's great-grandsire, dwarves have dwelled in Nordinbad. Though the hold was never rich in terms of gold and silver, of iron it has plenty and its beauty is worth more than any mountain of gold, carefully nurtured and enhanced by the faithful dwarves.\n\nWhile many other dwarf-holds in the Grey Mountains were consumed in Dragon-fire, the lack of conventional wealth steered the devastation away from Nordinbad's peaceful halls, and the Lords therein offered shelter to many survivors, for a time."
 dwarven.0300.a:0 "The beauty of Azan-zâram shall endure"
 
 ## Introduction ###

 dwarven.1000.t:0 "The Children of Mahal"
 dwarven.1000.desc:0 "I was born among the children of [mahalcharacter|E], adopted children of [eru|E], the steadfast [dwarves|E]. Our father shaped us in dark times, and as such we are hardier than [conceptracemen|E], and more resistant to illnesses and corruption.\n\nWe are long-lived and slow to bloom: we consider our youths to be no more than children until the age of their [majority|El] at 40, and that it is inappropriate to marry before the age of 70. Dwarves of both genders wear beards since birth, and a Dwarf without a beard is the object of much shame and mockery.\n\nThough we do not fear the sun like the [orcs|E], we are most comfortable beneath the ground, where we carve halls in the living rock. Many of our ancestral homes have been destroyed, and now is the time to reclaim them!"
