 rangers.0100.t:0 "The Chieftain of the Dúnedain"
 rangers.0100.desc:0 "Aragorn II, the 16th chieftain of the Dúnedain of Arnor, is an image of the strength and nobility borne by the men of Númenor before its fall, strong, wise, and regal in bearing. At the tender age of two, his father Arathorn perished to an orc arrow, and Aragorn was spirited by his mother Gilraen to Rivendell, where he was raised by Lord Elrond Peredhel as his foster-son.\n\nAt the age of twenty-one, Elrond revealed to his foster-son the truth of his high heritage, relinquishing to him the ring of Barahir and the shards of Narsil he had in his keeping, retaining only the sceptre of Annúminas. After this he fell in love with Arwen Undómiel, and she him, but Elrond set before Aragorn a task. He would only give his blessing for his daughter to marry Aragorn if he became the High-King of Arnor and Gondor, earning the Sceptre of Annúminas he had withheld.\n\nAragorn set out into the Wild, and traveling afar did many great deeds for the Free Peoples. Time shall tell if Aragorn achieves all he has hoped, or if the Heir of Isildur is doomed to share the fate of his forefathers."

 rangers.0200.t:0 "The Passing of Gilraen"
 rangers.0200.desc:0 "On one of his trips in the North, Aragorn visited with his mother Gilraen in autumn. After spending a few days together, he prepared to leave out on his next journey, when his mother came to speak with him. \n\n"This is our last parting, Estel, my son. I am aged by care, even as one of lesser Men; and now that it draws near, I cannot face the darkness of our time that gathers upon Middle-earth. I shall leave it soon." \n\nAragorn tried to comfort her, saying: "Yet there may be a light beyond the darkness; and if so, I would have you see it and be glad." \n\nBut she answered only with this linnod: Ónen i-Estel Edain, ú-chebin estel anim; "I gave Hope to the Dúnedain, I have kept no hope for myself." \n\nHeavy in his heart, Aragorn went away to his tasks and toil. Gilraen died before the next spring."
