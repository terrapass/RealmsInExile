druedain.0100.desc:0 "Many years have past since the passing of the great High Chieftain Zîghi and the fall of his realm with the chaos that ensued on his passing, A chaos caused by the evil Ân Zûn clan whom murdered his son and succesor Adrîm and many leal men through the most vile of betrayals. Many believed that the Buri Zîghi clan would have been beaten forever even when The Black Adder had to halt his march on Rast Vorn due to the bold attack of Pôn of the Ân Ghâwa clan and although unsuccesfull it made the Black Adder unable to continue with his goal of removing our clan from the face of Arda.. Yet now we have done what many have though to be impossible and retaken the realm of Zîghi proving ourselves to be true heirs of the great warrior, A new dawn has come for not just the Clan of Buri Zîghi but the beffraen people as a whole yet danger awaits in the shadows of the east a danger that if not stopped could be the end of all of Middle Earth..."
druedain.0100.a:0 "For the glory of the Heirs of Zîghi!"
