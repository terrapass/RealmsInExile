  ### STRANGE PAINTINGS ON MALLORN TREES ### 

  realms_galadhrim_filler.100:0 "Strange Markings"
  realms_galadhrim_filler.100_desc:0 "My sentries have brought me word of strange markings being found on some of the mallorn trees on the border. How this was achieved without alerting the sentries has baffled them and angered me.\n\nAction has to be taken, before whoever did this returns."
  realms_galadhrim_filler.100.a:0 "I will join the watch myself!"
  realms_galadhrim_filler.100.a_tt:0 "You join the sentries on their watch, to ensure the perpetrator is catched and dealt with."
  realms_galadhrim_filler.100.b:0 "Increasing the guard near the border should stop this"
  realms_galadhrim_filler.100.b_tt:0 "While you do not have time to ensure the safety of your realm, posting a few guards will have to do."
  realms_galadhrim_filler.100.c:0 "While serious, this matter will have to wait."
  realms_galadhrim_filler.100.c_tt:0 "You do not have time to handle every small detail of your kingdom."

  ### JOIN SENTRIES IN WATCH ###

  realms_galadhrim_filler.101:0 "Standing watch"
  realms_galadhrim_filler.101_desc:0 "As the night deepends, my watch begins. Luckily it is not long until I hear the snapping of branches underfoot, undoubtebly caused by the perpetrators of the strange markings.\n\n Will I ambush them from above the tree line, risking some of the enemy to escape, or will I order the sentries to engage them directly, risking injury but hopefully preventing any of escape."
  realms_galadhrim_filler.101.a:0 "From the trees, it is too dangerous."
  realms_galadhrim_filler.101.a_tt:0 "You risk letting some of the enemy run amock, but safety of your sentries are more important."
  realms_galadhrim_filler.101.b:0 "We cannot let them escape."
  realms_galadhrim_filler.101.b_tt:0 "You risk injury, but too risk any of them escaping is to much."

  ### AMBUSH ORCS THAT PAINTED PAINTINGS ###
  
  realms_galadhrim_filler.102:0 "Surprising the enemy"
  realms_galadhrim_filler.102_desc:0 "The sentries have mananaged to ambush a group of orcs wandering around the border. Just as I arrive arrows start to fly from the trees, killing most of the orc before they can even react.\n\nAs they are made aware of my small infantry squad, they viciously charge at us."
  realms_galadhrim_filler.102.a:0 "I will fight against this darkness!"
  realms_galadhrim_filler.102.a_tt:0 "You fight for your life amidst the melee"
  realms_galadhrim_filler.102.b:0 "I don't need to involve myself in this fight."
  realms_galadhrim_filler.102.b_tt:0 "You let your sentries handle the orcs."

  ### FLAMES DESTROYED TREES ###

  realms_galadhrim_filler.103:0 "Fiery Days"
  realms_galadhrim_filler.103_desc:0 "My marshal has brung me word of a terrible event that has taken place in one of our glades. Apparently a few of our mallorn trees were burned down due to the actions of ocs. He blames it on my carelessness as [ROOT.Char.GetTitleAsName].\n\nClearly he doesn't understand the pressure that I've been dealing with in these times. "
  realms_galadhrim_filler.103.a:0 "There was nothing else to do."
  realms_galadhrim_filler.103.a_tt:0 "Fortunately only trees were lost, although it could have been a lot worse."

  ### CAPTAINS DUEL ( YOU AND ENEMY CAPTAIN ) ###
  
  realms_galadhrim_filler.105:0 "Fighting the orcs"
  realms_galadhrim_filler.105_desc:0 "As I enter the skirmish, I notice a rather large orc dominating the field, with even his fellow orcs rather facing my sentries than stand too close to him and his bloodthirst.\n\nHe finally notices and starts walking towards me, bellowing a challenge."
  realms_galadhrim_filler.105.a:0 "Today is the day you die!"

  ### END OF BATTLE - DEFEAT ###

  realms_galadhrim_filler.107:0 "Death comes for all"
  realms_galadhrim_filler.107_desc:0 "You fought against the champion fiercely, yet it was not enough. As the blade descends for the final cut, you think on all you have done, and all you have left undone..."
  realms_galadhrim_filler.107.a:0 "Have I done enough?"
  realms_galadhrim_filler.107.a_tt:0 "You are slain by the orc champion, leaving your kingdom in mourning."

  ### END OF BATTLE - DID NOT JOIN IN ###
  realms_galadhrim_filler.108:0 "Cowardice has a price"
  realms_galadhrim_filler.108_desc:0 "As I stand amidst the aftermath of the skirmish, I can hear some of the sentries whispering among themselves on how I refused to fight along side them, yet ordered them to fight.\n\nWas it wrong of me to order them to risk their lives, or should I instead have fought beside them?"
  realms_galadhrim_filler.108.a:0 "A [ROOT.Char.GetTitleAsName] is too precious to risk in mere skirmishes."
