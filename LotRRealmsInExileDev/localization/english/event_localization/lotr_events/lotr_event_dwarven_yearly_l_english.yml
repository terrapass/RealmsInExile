 dwarven_yearly.0001.desc:0 "I'm enjoying a quiet evening beer when my steward [steward.GetFirstNameNoTooltip] comes to me, a worried look upon [steward.GetHerHis] face.\n\n"My liege, look at how battered and dented our tankards are! You can't quaff properly with these things. Half our guests end up with their clothes ruined after being soaked in alcohol. Something must be done!""
 dwarven_yearly.0001.a:0 "I'll send for the best tankards money can buy!"
 dwarven_yearly.0001.b:0 "I'll commission a local artisan to make new ones."

 dwarven_yearly.0002.desc:0 "As I am making my way through my halls I take notice of a rather vivid discussion between two of my courtiers seemingly about hunting.. \n\n"My liege, this man here seems so arrogant as to claim that he would best me in a hunting competition which is quite frankly outrageous!""

 dwarven_yearly.0003.t:0 "Grudge-bearer"
 dwarven_yearly.0003.desc:0 "Walking through the halls, I find a small leatherbound book left out on a table. Well-worn, it bears no name, but curiosity compels me to open it.\n\nWithin I find page upon page of writing in a sharp, cramped hand. After taking a moment to puzzle it out, my curiosity turns to befuddlement. Page upon page of minor slights and grievances, some going back years or decades! Accompanying many of them are notes of how to best 'avenge' the author's honor. How to repay someone who ate the last roll, the time and date of someone sitting in a favorite chair, the time a childhood toy was borrowed and returned late - the sheer vehemence of the author to the scale of the 'slights' is unbelievable!\n\nClosing it and placing it down, my brow furrows, before the harsh voice of [dwarven_char.GetName] bellows down the hall, "Have you seen a book around here? It should be small, well-worn, and leatherbound."
 dwarven_yearly.0003.a:0 "Do you mean this book?"
 dwarven_yearly.0003.b:0 "Did you write this, [dwarven_char.GetName]? We must speak!"

 dwarven_yearly.0004.t:0 "A New Cavern"
 dwarven_yearly.0004.desc:0 "As I study maps of my realm by lamplight, [dwarven_char.GetName] approaches me.\n\n"Sire, a group of miners have uncovered the entrance to a vast cavern system. They feared to explore it further without your leave. What shall be done?"\n\nSuch caverns can contain natural treasures, but also myriad dangers. Sending [dwarven_char.GetName] would avoid personal risk to me, but they would expect a cut of any profits. But if I were to lead the expedition through the cave myself..."
 dwarven_yearly.0004.a:0 "[dwarven_char.GetName] will lead the way!"

 dwarven_yearly.0004.b.failure:0 "You were attacked by blood-sucking bats."
 dwarven_yearly.0004.c:0 "Seal the cavern entrance. It's not worth the risk."
