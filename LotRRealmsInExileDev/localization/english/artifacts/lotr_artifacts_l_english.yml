Of late [secondage|E] Bellakarani manufacture, it has all the hallmarks of Numenorean craftsmanship.Yet the gently curving blade shows signs of being influenced by the scimitars of the [harad|E]rim.

Lost in the catastrophe of the Field of Black Death during the Tedjin invasion, it disappeared from history for nearly a century, before being rediscovered in the ruins of Joam after Bellakar’s sack of that city in TA 952.

As a young man, before he became king, he founded the Guild of Venturers, which would go on to have a glorious future during the Númenórean colonization of Middle-Earth. Erendis grew bitter towards Aldarion, and she withdrew to the sheep-lands of the countryside with their daughter Ancalimë, who remained their only child. Over time, Ancalimë, nicknamed the Princess Sheperdess, would inherit her mother's disdain for men. She would go on to become the first ruling Queen of Númenor, Tar-Ancalimë.
