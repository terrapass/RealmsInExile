 crown_of_gondor_description:0 "The original crown of Gondor was said to be a plain Númenórean war-helm, the one worn by the Númenórean Kings in the Battle of Dagorlad. As Anárion's helm was crushed when he was killed, the war-helm of Isildur was used for the crowning of the Kings of Gondor. In the days of Atanatar II Alcarin this was replaced by this jewelled crown, whose shape recalls the ancient warhelm. Before replying to the challenge of the Witch-king, Eärnur put the Crown in the lap of King Eärnil II in the Houses of the Dead and it remained there even after his loss, awaiting the return of the King. None of the Ruling Stewards have dared to don the Winged Crown, awaiting the return of the line of Anárion"

 niluzagar_name:0 "Nîluzagar"
 niluzagar_description:0 "The ancestral sword of the Tumakveh, Nîluzagar (‘Moon Blade’) has a storied history, yet somewhat mysterious origins. Of late Second Age Bellakarani manufacture, it has all the hallmarks of Numenorean craftsmanship.Yet the gently curving blade shows signs of being influenced by the scimitars of the Haradrim. Traditional accounts hold that it was made for Zagarthôr, lord of Nîlûlôni, and wielded during the battles of the Last Alliance, but scholars variously argue that it was made for the Lords of Narîk-Zadan, or that it was the ceremonial blade of the head of the Bâitha’n-Kadîr, symbolising its rule over all the peoples of Bellakar.\n\nWhatever the truth, it was in the hands of the Tumakveh by the time of the second King, Abâruzôr, who is depicted wielding it in contemporary portraits. Lost in the catastrophe of the Field of Black Death during the Tedjin invasion, it disappeared from history for nearly a century, before being rediscovered in the ruins of Joam after Bellakar’s sack of that city in TA 952. It remains a potent symbol of the endurance and tenacity of the Tumakveh."
