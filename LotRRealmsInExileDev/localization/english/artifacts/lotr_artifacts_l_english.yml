Of late [secondage|E] Bellakarani manufacture, it has all the hallmarks of Númenórean craftsmanship. Yet the gently curving blade shows signs of being influenced by the scimitars of the [harad|E]rim. Traditional accounts hold that it was made for Zagarthôr, lord of Nîlûlôni, and wielded during the battles of the [warlastalliance|E], but scholars variously argue that it was made for the Lords of Narîk-Zadan, or that it was the ceremonial blade of the head of the [baitha|E], symbolising its rule over all the peoples of [bellakar|E].\n\nWhatever the truth, it was in the hands of the Tumakveh by the time of the second King, Abâruzôr, who is depicted wielding it in contemporary portraits. Lost in the catastrophe of the Field of Black Death during the Tedjin invasion, it disappeared from history for nearly a century, before being rediscovered in the ruins of Joam after Bellakar’s sack of that city in TA 952. It remains a potent symbol of the endurance and tenacity of the Tumakveh."

An old story, it describes the lives of Tar-Aldarion, the sixth King of [numenor|E], and his wife Erendis, and how Aldarion's love of the sea eventually drove them apart. Indeed, Aldarion, whose grandfather had been the very first [numenorean|E] to lead an expedition to [middleearth|E], was enamoured with the sea. As a young man, before he became king, he founded the Guild of Venturers, which would go on to have a glorious future during the Númenórean colonisation of Middle-Earth. Erendis grew bitter towards Aldarion, and she withdrew to the sheep-lands of the countryside with their daughter Ancalimë, who remained their only child. Over time, Ancalimë, nicknamed the Princess Sheperdess, would inherit her mother's disdain for men. She would go on to become the first ruling Queen of Númenor, Tar-Ancalimë.
