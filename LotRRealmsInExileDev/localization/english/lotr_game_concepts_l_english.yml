 game_concept_bloodofnumenor:0 "Blood of Númenor"
 game_concept_bloodofnumenor_desc:0 "The Blood of Númenor is the blood of those descended from the Numenoreans, the inhabitants of the isle of [numenor|E]. The [valargods|E], on account of the valor of the Fathers of Men in the [concept1stage|E] and War of Wrath, gave to them a lifespan thrice that of lesser men and a land in which they lived in peace and prosperity. But in time the bliss of [numenor|E] waned, for the fear of death came among them, and forsaking their wisdom and friendship with the Eldar, hubris and lust for eternal life brought their doom.\n\nIn-game, the Blood of Númenor grants significant bonuses to longevity and stats. Unlike [congenital|E] traits, these bloodline traits cannot be 'upgraded' to a higher level and always face the risk of being lost. A child's chances of inheriting the greater bloodline trait from their parents is influenced by the moral character of the parents, with a more virtuous parentage resulting in greater chances of retaining the stronger Blood of Númenor trait. By contrast, morally wicked or corrupt characters are more likely to see the benefits of their prestigious bloodline fade away."

 game_concept_concept1stage_desc:0 "The First Age of Arda (F.A.) began with the first rising of the Sun, and ended with [melkorcharacter|E] being cast into the [thevoid|E]. For the first 400 years of the age the Long Peace endured, when the Ñoldor kept Morgoth besieged within Angband with a fence of swords. The Siege was broken in the Battle of Sudden Flame, and one by one the realms of the Ñoldor failed. \n\nIn the end only the combined forces of the [uttermostwest|E] and the Free Peoples of [beleriand|E] could cast down the Black Foe, resulting in the War of Wrath. In the aftermath, the continent of [beleriand|E] was sunken and [morgothcharacter|E] was cast into the [thevoid|E] through the Gates of Night. Thus ended the First Age."
 game_concept_concept2ndage:0 "Second Age"
 game_concept_concept2ndage_desc:0 "The Second Age of Arda (S.A.) began in the aftermath the War of Wrath. Many of the [elfexiles|E] chose to return to [aman|E], whereas those that opted to remain gathered under Erenion Gil-Galad or established kingdoms of their own. The Edain established the Kingdom of [numenor|E] in this age and reached the height of their power and bliss. It was in the early 1500s of this age that [sauroncharacter|E] came to the doors of Eregion and posed as an emissary of the [valargods|E], winning the friendship of [celebrimbor|E]. Thus, were the Great Rings brought into being, and in turn did Sauron craft the [oneringshort|E], the [rulingring|E]. War then came between Sauron and the Elves, ending with Sauron's defeat after a great host came from [numenor|E. Later in the age, the [numenoreans|E], growing proud and envious of the Eldar, spoke against the [banofthevalar|E]. In time, [sauroncharacter|E] was taken captive in [numenor|E], and from within at last corrupted them into open revolt, culminating in the [akallabeth|E]. The survivors of the Faithful of [numenor|E], the Eldar, and the Dwarves joined together in the War of the Last Alliance, and together overthrew Sauron, though the [rulingring|E] was not destroyed. Thus, ended the second age of [ardaconcept|E]." 
 game_concept_concept3rdage:0 "Third Age"
 game_concept_concept3rdage_desc:0 "The Third Age of Arda (T.A.) began with the defeat of Sauron in the Last Alliance. This age was dominated by the rise and declines of the Kingdoms-in-Exile, Gondor and Arnor. Arnor was split into three kingdoms after the death of [earendurcharacter|E], eventually being destroyed by the Kingdom of Angmar. Gondor grew in might and power, until it recalled the memory of Númenor of old, but it now has long declined, though still strong. The Elves became ever more concerned with conserving what lands they already held, and generally ceased attempting to expand. The Dwarves continued to prosper in their mountain halls until the fall of Khazad-Dum, when Durin's Bane awoke and slaid Durin VI, leading to the eventual foundation of the Kingdom of Erebor. In the dwindling days of the Third Age, Sauron prepared again to strike the Free Peoples, and hope rested on the edge of the knife. At the last, the valour of the smallest of beings, the Hobbits, unmade Sauron and all his works. The ring-bearer and the holders of the Three at last sailed into the Uttermost West, and thus ended the Third Age of Arda."
 game_concept_concept4thage:0 "Fourth Age"
 game_concept_concept4thage_desc:0 "The Fourth Age of Arda (F.A.) began when the Ringbearers and the Three passed over the sea to [valinor|E]. It's start was marked by the rise of a resurgent Dúnedain kingdom under King Elessar, but how it ended none can say..."

There beryl, pearl, and opal pale, and metal wrought like fishes' mail, Buckler and corslet, axe and sword, and shining spears were laid in hoard.\n\nUnwearied then were Durin's folk; Beneath the mountains music woke: The harpers harped, the minstrels sang, and at the gates the trumpets rang. \n\n The world is grey, the mountains old, the forge's fire is ashen-cold; No harp is wrung, no hammer falls: the darkness dwells in Durin's halls; The shadow lies upon his tomb, in Moria, in Khazad-dûm.
