 decision_dol_amroth_reforms_desc:0 "Long ago the Order of the Swan was created by the Princes of Dol Amroth to act as their personal advisors and fiercest champions in battle. Filled with renowned and grizzled captains of Belfalas, the Order held itself to the highest of standards, embodying true the height of Númenórean honor and virtue...\n\nUnfortunately, however, Men are easily corrupted, and in the centuries following its original foundation the Order slowly began to decay. Bloodlines and positions at court, not valor or individual virtue, now dictate the ranks of its members, muddling the grandeur of the Order that had for so many centuries stood as a beacon for all of Gondor. If the Sons of the Silver Swan are to reclaim their legacy as the Kingdom's finest knights, the ill-festering state of the Order must be mended."
 decision_dol_amroth_reforms_confirm:0 "Begin the training at once."

 decision_dol_amroth_amrothian_troops_desc:0 "For years relugated to being the most humble of positions within the Order of the Swan, the Amrothian soldiery has in many ways been the group which have maintained the true spirit of the original Order the best. However, in spite of this, their ranks have been sadly depleted, the role viewed as lacking in honor and splendor and thus neglected. \n\nLet us work on restoring this backbone of our forces to their proper fighting strength."

 decision_dol_amroth_elvish_troops:0 "Recruit the Men of Edhellond"
 decision_dol_amroth_elvish_troops_tooltip:0 "Recruit a contingent of Edhellond Knights and Rangers" 
 decision_dol_amroth_elvish_troops_desc:0 "Edhellond, once-home of the Elven domain of the same name, is one of the noblest and richest governates of Dor-en-Ernil. They strive to emulate Elven tactics in warfare, in contrast with the rest of Gondor, who maintain a firm martial tradition inherited from the days of Númenor. Their ranks amongst the Order have sat empty, oaths unsaid as the rot festered within the organization. We must make anew our oaths of old. \n\nIf they could be reintegrated into the armies of the Prince, they could serve as a powerful and innovative contingent." 
 decision_dol_amroth_elvish_troops_confirm:0 "Send our fastest rider."

 decision_dol_amroth_seaward_troops_tooltip:0 "Begin the training of a Sea-ward Regiment" 
 decision_dol_amroth_seaward_troops_desc:0 "Once the Dor-en-Ernil equal to the mighty marines of Pelargir, the Sea-ward regiments fought on the high seas and the coasts, besting corsairs and winning high honors. However, as Pelargir has risen in prominence as the heart of the Royal Navy, this guard division has dwindled to a skeleton force, maintaining a few coastal lookouts at most. \n\nIf we could expand them once more, they would once again serve us well as fearsome shock-troops."

 decision_dol_amroth_tirith_aear_troops_desc:0 "The Tirith-Aear, or 'Sea-ward Tower' in Sindarin, is the great tower of Dor-en-Ernil, once built by the Elves dwelling within the region. The name has also become that of the elite guard units which protect the tower, the Oathkeepers of Tirith-Aear, the most elite of the Sea-ward troops. Required to swear oaths of virtue and valor, these wardens should be of unimpeacheable character. But of all the classes of the old Order, this one rotted most, with the position being given on account of blood, not valor. It will require great effort to rebuild it to its former glory. \n\nWe shall begin by dismissing those of the order known to be corrupt, and then begin searching for those worthy of this great honor." 
 decision_dol_amroth_tirith_aear_troops_confirm:0 "Speak the oaths." 
 
 decision_dol_amroth_swan_guard_troops:0 "Establish the Order of the Silver Swan"
 decision_dol_amroth_swan_guard_troops_tooltip:0 "Begin the training of an elite detachment of Silver Swan Knights" 
 decision_dol_amroth_swan_guard_troops_desc:0 "The epitome of Númenórean valor, the Royal Order of the Silver Swan is an image of the nobility of Men at the height of their virtue. Of unmatched moral fibre and great skill in arms, only a select few are ever counted amongst this most hallowed order. To be offered such a chance is accounted an honor beyond price in the lands of Dol Amroth, and few refuse it, for it is both a great honor and a crushing duty. \n\nWith these handpicked warriors, paragons of valor and skill, the Prince has nothing to fear, for he is guarded by the most capable men in all of Dor-en-Ernil." 
 decision_dol_amroth_swan_guard_troops_confirm:0 "A beacon of honour." 

 decision_construct_grond:0 "Construct Grond"
 decision_construct_tooltip:0 "Construction of the Grond Siege Unit will begin"
 decision_construct_desc:0 "Great engines crawled across the field; and in the midst was a huge ram, great as a forest-tree a hundred feet in length, swinging on mighty chains. Long had it been forging in the dark smithies of Mordor, and its hideous head, founded of black steel, was shaped in the likeness of a ravening wolf; on it spells of ruin lay. Grond they named it, in memory of the Hammer of the Underworld of old. Great beasts drew it, orcs surrounded it, and behind walked mountain-trolls to wield it."
 decision_construct_confirm:0 "The Hammer of the Underworld shall lay low all cities"
 decision_construct_tool_tip_2:0 "Construction of the Grond Siege Unit will begin"
 grond:0 "Grond"

 decision_search_orthanc:0 "Search Orthanc"
 decision_search_orthanc_desc_tooltip:0 "You will search the Tower of Orthanc for hidden treauries and mysteries."
 decision_search_orthanc_desc:0 "The Tower of Orthanc has for centuries served as Saruman's dwelling, resulting in many things both strange and wondrous likely being hoarded within. We should assemble a search party to see what he might have hidden within those bleak, ancient halls."
 decision_search_orthanc_confirm:0 "Leave no stone unturned!"

 decision_denethor_palantir:0 "Gaze into the Palantír of Minas Anor"
 decision_denethor_palantir_tooltip:0 "You will endeavor to increase your knowledge of the world."
 decision_denethor_palantir_desc:0 "Amongst the coveted artifacts hidden within Minas Tirith is the Palantír of Minas Anor. Wrought in the ancient west by Fëanor, the seven seeing-stones were gifted to Amandil of Andúnië by the Eldar of Tol Eressëa, as comfort to the Faithful as the Shadow fell upon Númenor. Brought to Middle-earth by Anárion, the Anor-stone has not been used since the fall of Minas Ithil to the Witch-King, for the Wise of Gondor deemed the danger too great. Its very existence has, for centuries, been a secret of the Ruling Stewards, who feared that should its location be revealed, the enemy shall seek to steal its power. \n\nThe Palantíri are tools of farsight, allowing its bearer to perceive things unseen, in far-away lands, and to communicate with the other seeing-stones. They are dangerous tools in this age, for it takes great will to master a Palantír and bend it to ones purpose - and even then, you do not know who else might bear another and attempt to so strike you in return. But with great strength of mind and spirit, a Palantír could be a weapon unmatched. Gazing into the Anor Stone might unveil secrets most important, revealing the plans of the enemy and granting insight into their strategies. \n\nShould I then use the Palantír in order to grow my own strength and wisdow, or is the danger simply too great?"
 decision_denethor_palantir_confirm:0 "No secret shall remain hidden."
