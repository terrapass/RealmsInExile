 harad.0100.desc:0 "Five generations of men ago, Khadnom, a zealous believer in the Gods, rallied the Chelkar people against the cruel Haruze kings and their cult of the vile serpent. From that revolt was reborn the ancient kingdom of Chelkar, a mighty trading state which sat at the crossroads of ancient empires and grew fabulously rich from it. \n\nHis son, Safal the Stalwart, repulsed 3 attempts by the Haruze kings to reconquer what they had lost, dealing a death-blow to their waning power. But his son, Sagalion, proved less capable on all fronts, and was a weak and inneffectual leader. He was ultimately assassinated, with the prime suspect the resurgent Haruze kingdom under Sûladan. Perhaps he hoped to weaken the Chelkar by placing them under the rule of a young child. \n\nBut if that was the intent, a miscalculation was made, for Kalafar is a man of the make of his grandfather - a strong warrior, zealous in his faith to the old ways. His brother Sinil has also risen to the challenge and now serves his brother as a leal lord, despite offers from Haruzan to elevate him to the title of viceroy if he would betray Kalafar. \n\nNow, Chelkar again raises its fence of swords in defiance against a world that once more seeks to extinguish them. Serpents coil to the west, and to the north, dark winds come down from the mountains, seeking to secure its southern flank..."
