 harad.0100.t:0 "The Chelkar Revolt"
 harad.0100.desc:0 "Five generations of men ago, Khadnom, a zealous believer in the Gods, rallied the Chelkar people against the cruel Haruze kings and their cult of the vile serpent. From that revolt was reborn the ancient kingdom of Chelkar, a mighty trading state which sat at the crossroads of ancient empires and grew fabulously rich from it. \n\nHis son, Safal the Stalwart, repulsed 3 attempts by the Haruze kings to reconquer what they had lost, dealing a death-blow to their waning power. But his son, Sagalion, proved less capable on all fronts, and was a weak and inneffectual leader. He was ultimately assassinated, with the prime suspect the resurgent Haruze kingdom under Sûladan. Perhaps he hoped to weaken the Chelkar by placing them under the rule of a young child. \n\nBut if that was the intent, a miscalculation was made, for Kalafar is a man of the make of his grandfather - a strong warrior, zealous in his faith to the old ways. His brother Sinil has also risen to the challenge and now serves his brother as a leal lord, despite offers from Haruzan to elevate him to the title of viceroy if he would betray Kalafar. \n\nNow, Chelkar again raises its fence of swords in defiance against a world that once more seeks to extinguish them. Serpents coil to the west, and to the north, dark winds come down from the mountains, seeking to secure its southern flank..."

 harad.0200.t:0 "Sûladan's Ambitions"
 harad.0200.desc:0 "150 years ago, the great dominion of the Haruze Kings was shattered. The Chelkar Revolt shattered any sembelance of unity the kingdom had, and Amrûn was sacked. Bit by bit, the Haruze Kingdom crumbled, the border regions breaking off into warlords. Now, the Kingdom of Haruzan is a sad remnant of its former glory. But Sûladan seeks to change that. \n\nBorn at the end of his father's life as an only son, Sûladan possesses a great fire in his heart. While he could do little while in his minority, with regents controlling affairs of state, he spent his youth dreaming grand visions of a restored Haradwaith. Now, in the fullness of his rule, Sûladan finds a world in chaos, his house's old foes weak and hobbled. \n\nThe rebel-king in Chelkar suffered an unfortunate accident, leaving the region under the control of a boy-king. Meanwhile, his cousin Balkuthôr desires to push his claim to lands in Pezarsan, promising to swear allegiance to Sûladan in exchange for his aid. And to the north, the Serpent-King Khäz-gramaze readies to finally annihilate the hated Sea-peoples. \n\nHaruzan's hour is nigh, if Sûladan has but the strength to grasp it."
