 ### Beorning Events ###

 anduin_vale.0100.t:0 "The Beornings"
 anduin_vale.0100.desc:0 "In the aftermath of the Battle of Five Armies, the mysterious skinchanger Beorn reluctantly accepted the mantle of leadership over many tribes of the Anduin Vale and western Mirkwood, taking to wife Medulynn, the daughter of the chieftain of the Olphanging tribe. \n\nHis son Grimbeorn, of like mind and stature to his father, now rules over a wide realm between the mountains and the deep forest. The 'Beornings', as they are known, keep open the High Pass, the Ford of Carrock, and the western stretches of the Old Forest Road (or 'Viduweg', as the woodmen name it), keeping the mountain goblins at bay. \n\nYet to the south, an evil has returned to the cursed fortress of Dol Guldur. And to the north, rumours come of renewed raids by the goblins of Gundabad. In these darkening days, will the Beornings keep the fractious tribes united and resist the machinations of their foes? Or will they be swept aside before the rising tide, like so many of the petty realms that preceded them, with the legacy of Beorn forgotten forever?"
 anduin_vale.0100.a:0 "United, the wood and vale will stand!"

 anduin_vale.0102.t:0 "The Realm of the All-Thane"
 anduin_vale.0102.desc:0 "For time out of mind, the Woodmen and their brethren in the Vale have remained fiercely independent, both from outsiders and from each other. Only in the direst of need have the fractious tribes elected a single ruler, the All-Thane or 'Aledegan', to unite their efforts against a common enemy. \n\nBut times have changed. Under your dynasty a great realm has been forged, uniting both the Anduin Vale and the traditional lands of the Woodmen in the great forest of Greenwood. The disparate folk of Wood and Vale have all acknowledged your leadership, and the right of your heirs to rule in perpetuity. Never again will your people be divided, to fall prey to predatory orcs, wargs and worse. You have created the Realm of the All-Thane - the Aladagana!"
 anduin_vale.0102.a:0 "And I am the Aladegan!"
 anduin_vale.0102.a.tt:0 "You have created the empire title of Aladegana"

 ### Framling Events ###

 anduin_vale.0103.t:0 "The Framlings"
 anduin_vale.0103.desc:0 "The Framlings are possessed of pride and long memories. But pride does not fill a belly, nor memory defend against a cruel blade. They have long been a dwindling people, haunted by grief at their abandonment by their kin. \n\nIn their own tongue they label themselves the Éowealafa - “The horses left behind”. Left behind by Eorl, who took the greater part of the Éothéod south to win great renown. Left behind by Leof, who led many of those who remained to a less honourable fate. Yet a remnant of the Éothéod still eke out an existence in the foothills of the Grey Mountains, clinging to their horses and their traditions. \n\nErwigiar Alarichosson, descendant of Fram, finds himself a king on a precipice. Will his people fall to the resurgent goblins of the mountains, or be swept aside by the primitives woodmen who have usurped the Vale where his ancestors once rode? Or will he and his descendants prove themselves worthy of their forefathers, conquer the lands between mountain and wood, and claim their birthright as the true heirs of the Éothéod?"
 anduin_vale.0103.a:0 "Forth Framlingas!"
 anduin_vale.0103.a.tt:0 "The fate of the Framlings is in your hands."
