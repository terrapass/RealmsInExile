 ### Beorning Events ###

 anduin_vale.0100.t:0 "The Beornings"
 anduin_vale.0100.desc:0 "In the aftermath of the Battle of Five Armies, the mysterious skinchanger Beorn reluctantly accepted the mantle of leadership over many tribes of the Anduin Vale and western Mirkwood, taking to wife Medulynn, the daughter of the chieftain of the Olphanging tribe. \n\nHis son Grimbeorn, of like mind and stature to his father, now rules over a wide realm between the mountains and the deep forest. The 'Beornings', as they are known, keep open the High Pass, the Ford of Carrock, and the western stretches of the Old Forest Road (or 'Viduweg', as the woodmen name it), keeping the mountain goblins at bay. \n\nYet to the south, an evil has returned to the cursed fortress of Dol Guldur. And to the north, rumours come of renewed raids by the goblins of Gundabad. In these darkening days, will the Beornings keep the fractious tribes united and resist the machinations of their foes? Or will they be swept aside before the rising tide, like so many of the petty realms that preceded them, with the legacy of Beorn forgotten forever?"
