I am beginning to wonder whether this rumoured wolf den even exists, or if the wolves that have been prowling these lands are the result of some magic or devilry.\n\nFinally my last scout reports to me, his clothes ragged and a shaken look in his eyes.\n\n'My [ROOT.Char.GetLadyLord], I have found it! The den is well concealed, in the deepest reaches of the [obstacle_province.Custom('TerrainTypeProvince')], and the wolves there are many and fierce'."
