 wasteland_blocker.0001.desc:0 "My scouts have been scouring the [obstacle_province.Custom('TerrainTypeProvince')] of [obstacle_province.GetName] for days.\n\nMost have returned empty-handed, some have not returned at all. I am beginning to wonder whether this rumoured wolf den even exists, or if the wolves that have been prowling these lands are the result of some magic or devilry.\n\nFinally my last scout reports to me, his clothes ragged and a shaken look in his eyes.\n\n'My [ROOT.Char.GetLadyLord], I have found it! The den is well concealed, in the deepest reaches of the [obstacle_province.Custom('TerrainTypeProvince')], and the wolves there are many and fierce'."

 wasteland_blocker.0011.desc:0 "My settlers in [obstacle_province.GetName] are used to bears roaming near their colony. A little extra caution is ordinarily all that is required, and even the more inquisitive beasts can normally be deterred by the vigorous clanging of cooking pans.\n\nOne bear is different. Known as ‘Yoh-gi’ in the local dialect, he is smarter than the average bear, stalking working parties and attacking them whenever they pause for a repast. As soon as the workers have scattered he raids their baggage for supplies, stealing any food they have brought with them.\n\nThere is considerable debate in the settlement as to how to deal with the problem. The colony has employed rangers, who wish to mount an expedition against the bear. However, the settlement’s smith believes the bear can be lured into an ingenious trap of his own design, bated with a honey-laden beehive."

 wasteland_blocker.0012.t:0 "Beargild"
 wasteland_blocker.0012.desc.1:0 "After four days tramping across hard country, my bear hunt nears its finale. A great she-bear stands in the mouth of a cave, her gaze fixed on me. She rears on her hind legs and roars, but seems reluctant to charge and leave the shelter of her rocky recess. Taking this for a sign of weakness, I leap forward and plunge my spear into her chest. After a short struggle the bear collapses, twitching. With her last strength she looks into my eyes again with an expression that looks almost… pleading. Disconcerted, I step back and drop the spear.\n\nIt is then that I hear the mewling.\n\nAt the back of the cave I find the source of the noise - a tiny cub, still blind and feeble, crawls towards me. "
