 enedwaith.0100.t:0 "The Mad Dog of Saralain"
 enedwaith.0100.desc:0 "Madogh of House Morcad inherited a kingship that is more a figurehead than a fact. This has been the unfortunate reality of Saralain for many generations now, and in truth has always somewhat been the case. The clans of the Saralain have ever been bound more by blood and kinship than oaths of fealty, but even still, the kings possessed some authority to guide and govern the clans. \n\nWell, not for many years has that been the case. Now, the authority of Saralain in truth has been reduced to the lands of Ironwarf itself. Madogh's ascension has brought mixed reactions - his cruelty and short temper have alienated those who might have been his allies, but at the same time has also given birth to hope that he might have the iron needed to reforge the clans of Saralain into a united people once more."
