 # Reflavoured Scarborough Fair
 flavourevent.0001.t:0 "Fair Sounds on the Wind"
 flavourevent.0001.desc.start:0 "As I walked along the path leading to my home in the late evening, my vision faded and my mind became filled with sweet sounds drifting on the wind."
 flavourevent.0001.desc.end.good:0 "It was difficult to describe at first, but finally it became clear - rushing waters, and in the distance the ringing of crystal bells and melodies on harp-string.\n\nI feel a bone-deep sense of peace settle into me - is this a gift of the Master of Dreams, to feel the contentment of his gardens?"
 flavourevent.0001.desc.end.evil:0 "It was difficult to describe at first, but finally it became clear - the pained groans of my suffering enemies fill the air, a nectar sweeter than any wine.\n\nThe beating of hammers echo in the background, the heralds of the coming conquest. My mind clearing, the premonition has given me a new sense of confidence!"
 flavourevent.0001.a:0 "Truly the sweetest of sounds!"
 
 flavourevent.0002.t:0 "Foul Sounds on the Wind"
 flavourevent.0002.desc.start:0 "As I walked along the path leading to my home in the late evening, my vision faded and my mind became filled with foul sounds drifting on the wind."
 flavourevent.0002.desc.end.good:0 "I could scarcely make anything out of it - what an awful racket! It was as if an entire army was clanging it's swords directly in my ear, combined with a shrill wail and the endless beating of drums, rattling my skull.\n\nMake it stop..."
 flavourevent.0002.desc.end.evil:0 "At first it was just some mild rustling, but then I heard it - water. Great, unimaginable amounts of water, rushing forth in a torrent that would drown me where I stood. I shook, paralyzed with dread, my heart beating with the force of a hundred drums. The water comes!\n\nMake it stop..."
 flavourevent.0002.a:0 "MAKE IT STOP!"
 
 # Reflavoured Baklava Gift
 flavourevent.0003.t:0 "Honey Cakes"
 flavourevent.0003.desc:0 "On a visit to a nearby town, I was approached by a travelling merchant peddling his wares. The man, a well-traveled gastronome who enjoys discovering the foods of different lands, offered me honey cakes from the Vales of Anduin for a modest price.\n\nSweet, delicate and dripping with amber honey, they would surely be a rare treat to eat!"
 flavourevent.0003.a:0 "I'll take them!"
 flavourevent.0003.b:0 "Do I look like I want some cake?"
 
 # Reflavoured Oblivion Conversation
 flavourevent.0004.t:0 "Gossiping Servants"
 flavourevent.0004.desc:0 "While going about my daily routine I couldn't help but overhear heated gossip between two of my servants, dragging up all manner of petty grudges and supposed slights.\n\nI am getting rather tired of their ramblings and wonder whether I should keep listening to their chatter, which I find inane and devoid of substance."
 flavourevent.0004.a:0 "I'll find something else to distract myself with."
 flavourevent.0004.b:0 "I have nothing better to do, who knows what I might learn."
 flavourevent.0004.c:0 "Make an example of them. Kill them both."
 
 # Reflavoured forgotten dream
 flavourevent.0005.t:0 "A Forgotten Dream?"
 flavourevent.0005.desc:0 "I had the most amazing dream last night! After I woke up, I immediately found the nearest person, one of my servants, and began to recount what had happened.\n\nExcept... by that point I had forgotten what had happened in my dream. I stumbled over my words as I struggled to recall any details as my servant stood there awkwardly.\n\nWhy is it often too easy to forget what the Master of Desires has shown us in our dreams?"
 flavourevent.0005.a:0 "How irritating. Oh well!"
 flavourevent.0005.b:0 "I must remember! Why can't I? Why?"
 flavourevent.0005.a.a:0 "You remember what the dream was about"
 flavourevent.0005.toast.a:0 "You remembered what the dream was about"
 flavourevent.0005.a.b:0 "You still can't remember what the dream was about"
 flavourevent.0005.toast.b:0 "You forgot what the dream was about"
