 ### SARUMAN EVENTS ###
 saruman.0001.t:0 "The Lord of Isengard"
 saruman.0001.desc:0 "Isengard was not made by you, but by the Men of Númenor long ago; it is very tall and has many secrets; yet it looks not to be a work of craft.\n\nIt was at the crowning of Fréaláf King of the Riddermark, that you appeared, bringing gifts, and speaking great praise of the valour of the Rohirrim. All knew you a welcome guest. Soon after you took up your abode in Isengard, for Beren, the Steward of Minas Tirith, had gave you the keys to Orthanc; and from that year on 2759 TA you have dwelt in Isengard.\n\nYou became a lord of Men; for at first you held Isengard as a lieutenant of the Steward and warden of the tower. Fréaláf was as glad as Beren to have this so, and know that Isengard was in the hands of a strong friend. A friend you long were, and you kept the tower as part of the defences of the West, so long as you yourself remained the chief person in that defence, and the head of its council.\n\nYour subjects are mixed Rohirrim and Dunlending, and no longer do you consider the realm of Gondor as your liege."
 saruman.0001.a:0 "The rule of Isengard is now mine, as are its secrets."
 saruman.0001.a.tt:0 "You are no longer a vassal of the Lord of Minas Tirith."
 saruman.0001.a.tt2:0 "You have access to the Orthanc palantír, a seeing stone."
 saruman.0001.a.tt3:0 "You may use the palantír via an initial, major decision and continue to use it via a minor decision."
 saruman.0001.b:0 "I shall remain a vassal of the Lord Denethor of Minas Tirith."
 saruman.0001.b.tt:0 "You remain a vassal of the Lord of Minas Tirith."

 decision_saruman_palantir_introduction_desc:0 "The palantír, when used by someone of great strength of will and mind, can be directed to show objects and events far away. Between two palantír stones it allows visual communication."

 saruman.0002.t:0 "The Orthanc Stone"
 saruman.0002.desc:0 "In the middle of your throne-room is a black stand. On it, a black cloth covering the palantír, the greatest of the secrets of Isengard.\n\nGandalf would advise you to disregard its power. The grey fool miscalculates your wisdom and strength.\n\nSauron has a palantír: the captured Ithil Stone of Minas Ithil. That is guessed correctly by you. In the past you have felt his gaze on Isengard. But you are powerful enough to resist him, shrouding your valley in secrecy from his eye.\n\nIn this hour you will wrestle with Sauron and claim mastery over this powerful tool and use it in your quest."
 saruman.0002.a:0 "I will find the One Ring. And bring order to Middle-earth."
 saruman.0002.a.tt:0 "You gaze into the palantír."
 saruman.0002.b:0 "To gaze into the palantír is folly; Sauron seeks me."
 saruman.0002.b.tt:0 "You do not gaze into the palantír yet."
 
 saruman.0003.t:0 "The Palantír"
 saruman.0003.desc:0 "In the darkness of your throne room, the black cloth is lifted, you reach out towards the crystal ball and command it to show you the One Ring. It respects your power and sweeps over the Gladden Fields. The scene is visible, wilderness of marshlands, the Gladden Fields, where you have searched ceaselessly to discover the Ring. It is not there. You search further and are directed over Mirkwood and towards the Sea of Rhûn, where you observe the endless armies of the Men of Rhûn, but someone else is watching.\n\nSauron has found you; concealed within his fortress, the Lord of Mordor sees all with the captured Ithil Stone. His form is a great eye, lidless, wreathed in flame. His reaching flames pierce through the palantír and drive into your arms, he is seeking to learn your designs. The vision of the palantír shows scenes of Sauron’s utter conquest of the east and south. Sauron does not know yet of your purpose, but you must either deceive him, feigning allegiance, or you must fight for control of the palantír."
 saruman.0003.a:0 "Saruman pledges allegiance to you, lord Sauron."
 saruman.0003.a.tt:0 "Pledge allegiance to Sauron, convert to the Cult of the Lidless Eye. Continue your search to claim the One Ring."
 saruman.0003.b:0 "You shall not have the Orthanc Stone, Dark Lord."
 saruman.0003.b.tt:0 "Strive against Sauron, wrest control over the Orthanc Stone."

I tell him of the attacks on the Westfold and the destruction that I believe Saruman is behind. He assures me that the White Wizard is our ally, and this must be some trickery of the Enemy. After conferring with my father, Grima commands me to investigate the matter myself or be banished from Rohan for disobedience!"
