 ### SARUMAN EVENTS ###
 saruman.0001.t:0 "The Lord of Isengard"
 saruman.0001.desc:0 "Isengard was not made by you, but by the Men of Númenor long ago; it is very tall and has many secrets; yet it looks not to be a work of craft.\n\nIt was at the crowning of Fréaláf King of the Riddermark, that you appeared, bringing gifts, and speaking great praise of the valour of the Rohirrim. All knew you a welcome guest. Soon after you took up your abode in Isengard, for Beren, the Steward of Minas Tirith, had gave you the keys to Orthanc; and from that year on 2759 TA you have dwelt in Isengard.\n\nYou became a lord of Men; for at first you held Isengard as a lieutenant of the Steward and warden of the tower. Fréaláf was as glad as Beren to have this so, and know that Isengard was in the hands of a strong friend. A friend you long were, and you kept the tower as part of the defences of the West, so long as you yourself remained the chief person in that defence, and the head of its council.\n\nYour subjects are mixed Rohirrim and Dunlending, and no longer do you consider the realm of Gondor as your liege."
 saruman.0001.a:0 "The rule of Isengard is now mine, as are its secrets."
 saruman.0001.a.tt:0 "You are no longer a vassal of the Lord of Minas Tirith."
 saruman.0001.a.tt2:0 "You have access to the Orthanc palantír, a seeing stone."
 saruman.0001.a.tt3:0 "You may use the palantír via an initial, major decision and continue to use it via a minor decision."
 saruman.0001.b:0 "I shall remain a vassal of the Lord Denethor of Minas Tirith."
 saruman.0001.b.tt:0 "You remain a vassal of the Lord of Minas Tirith."

 saruman.0002.t:0 "The Orthanc Stone"
 saruman.0002.desc:0 "In the middle of your throne-room is a black stand. On it, a black cloth covering the palantír, the greatest of the secrets of Isengard.\n\nGandalf would advise you to disregard its power. The grey fool miscalculates your wisdom and strength.\n\nSauron has a palantír: the captured Ithil Stone of Minas Ithil. That is guessed correctly by you. In the past you have felt his gaze on Isengard. But you are powerful enough to resist him, shrouding your valley in secrecy from his eye.\n\nIn this hour you will wrestle with Sauron and claim mastery over this powerful tool and use it in your quest."
 saruman.0002.a:0 "I will find the One Ring. And bring order to Middle-earth."
 saruman.0002.a.tt:0 "You gaze into the palantír."
 saruman.0002.b:0 "To gaze into the palantír is folly; Sauron seeks me."
 saruman.0002.b.tt:0 "You do not gaze into the palantír yet."
 
 saruman.0003.t:0 "The Palantír"
 saruman.0003.desc:0 "In the darkness of your throne room, the black cloth is lifted, you reach out towards the crystal ball and command it to show you the One Ring. It respects your power and sweeps over the Gladden Fields. The scene is visible, wilderness of marshlands, the Gladden Fields, where you have searched ceaselessly to discover the Ring. It is not there. You search further and are directed over Mirkwood and towards the Sea of Rhûn, where you observe the endless armies of the Men of Rhûn, but someone else is watching.\n\nSauron has found you; concealed within his fortress, the Lord of Mordor sees all with the captured Ithil Stone. His form is a great eye, lidless, wreathed in flame. His reaching flames pierce through the palantír and drive into your arms, he is seeking to learn your designs. The vision of the palantír shows scenes of Sauron’s utter conquest of the east and south. Sauron does not know yet of your purpose, but you must either deceive him, feigning allegiance, or you must fight for control of the palantír."
 saruman.0003.a:0 "Saruman pledges allegiance to you, lord Sauron."
 saruman.0003.a.tt:0 "Pledge allegiance to Sauron, convert to the Cult of the Lidless Eye. Continue your search to claim the One Ring."
 saruman.0003.b:0 "You shall not have the Orthanc Stone, Dark Lord."

Yet these orcs seem far too organized to be come out of the mountains, and they bear a strange mark - a White Hand on a field of black. At this late hour, what new foe do we face? The White Wizard has grown reclusive of late, and my heart forebodes the long silence of Isengard has not been contemplation, but preparation." 
theodred.0100.a:0 "Summon the riders. I will investigate these rumors myself." 
theodred.0100.a.tt:0 "Ride west with your men and put an end to the attacks" 
theodred.0100.b:0 "Make preperations to depart for Edoras, I will speak with my father."

theodred.0101.t:0 "The Westfold Aflame" 
theodred.0101.desc:0 "Riding hard through the night, we came at last to the town of Fowlmere. But we came far too late. Fire engulfs the fields and the homes, and smoke chokes the very air. We can scarce endure it, but we must. We find at last a surviving villager, who tells us the whole harrowing tale. Dunlending raiders and orcs bearing great plate armor branded with the reported White Hand struck them in the morning. Through the chaos of the slaughter, he claims to have heard the name of Saruman mentioned by both the Orcs and the Dunlendings while he hid. So what I feared is true. Saruman has betrayed us."

My men have availed themselves honorably, and we have dealt a furious blow to their force, but I fear the enemy succeeded in their objective. While most of my army has successfully withdrawn, my guard and I found ourselves cut off by a final charge. My retainers lie dead, and I fear I am to follow soon..."

Forgive me Father, for I go now to the halls of our forefathers. May you have the wisdom to guide our people, and to protect them where I could not..."

theodred.0105.t:0 "Instructions From Grima" 
theodred.0105.desc:0 "Arriving at Edoras, my father's advisor Grima hurridly takes me aside. Sympathy in his eyes, he tells me in a hushed tone that my father has been taken gravely ill, and that for the time being the rule of Edoras has been entrusted to him. I quickly relate to him the reports I've recieved from the Westfold. He looks at me, taken aback, before recovering quickly. He assures me it must be a trick of the Enemy, for Saruman has long and faithfully held the border as a friend of Rohan. Excusing himself, he goes to try to confer with my father. \n\nGrima returned in a few hours, handing me a scroll with a command from the King. Kindly, Grima tells me not to think too harshly of my father, for he remains not well. Father's decree reads that I am to ride with a force to the Isen to investigate these reports personally. Under no circumstances am I to take aggresive actions until I have definitive proof, or face banishment."
