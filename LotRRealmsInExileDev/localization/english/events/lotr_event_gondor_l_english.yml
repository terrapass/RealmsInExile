 ### DENETHOR EVENTS ###
 gondor.0100.t:0 "The Steward of Gondor"
 gondor.0100.desc:0 "For twenty-five generations the Stewards of Gondor have kept a vigilant watch over the lands of Gondor, serving as its keepers and highest authority until the return of a rightful claimant to its kingship. Hardships—innumerable and often terrible, have come to pass during these times. There is no peace, for the men of Gondor can afford no such relief. Men are raised into soldiers instead of scholars; and iron is wrought into devices meant for war and nothing else.\n\nThe kingdom’s strength in waning. To the East a Great Shadow stirs. A nameless fear besieges the eastern shore. Patrols vanish without a word, and tradesmen are harried along the coasts. The decisive hour approaches, and for the kingdom of Gondor to endure it will need the likes Cirion or Ecthelion to lead its peoples.\n\nAlas, then, that these dark days should fall upon the vindictive Steward Denethor. He is a man loved by few and distrusted by many. And although the early days of his rule boded well for the kingdom’s future, the sudden death of his wife Finduilas wracked him greatly. Grief-stricken, he is silent whenever command is needed; and he is grim whenever hope seems within grasp…\n\nUncertain, is the future of Gondor. It stands on a razor’s edge, and a single breeze could cast it down into the depths of darkness. But likewise, it could perhaps be restored to its former greatness just as quickly. Whatever might occur, in this moment the looming shadow moves ever-westward, encompassing all with its darkness and destruction..."
 gondor.0100.a:0 "There is an Evil in Mordor that does not sleep."
 gondor.0100.a.tt:0 "We must prepare. He comes."
 
 ### BOROMIR EVENTS ###
 gondor.0200.t:0 "The Captain of Gondor"
 gondor.0200.desc:0 "For many years it has been a tradition for the heir to Gondor - either of the Kings or the Stewards - to serve as the Captain of the White Tower. These are the leader of the Citadel Guard, bearer of the Horn of Gondor, and head of the armies of Gondor after the Steward himself. No man was ever born more suited to the role than Boromir, elder son of the Steward Denethor. \n\nLoved and respected by his people and his men, Boromir is a man of the make of King Eärnur. Bearing great strength and valour, he is an honorable man, with a burning desire to see his people safe from the encroaching shadow. He is not a man much concerned with the old lore and wisdoms, save in the tales of old battles, and his zeal for his country may be yet his salvation or his damnation. \n\nTo the Captain of the White Tower Gondor looks, and upon him is its hope laid and remain, lest some hope unlooked for comes to rally the people once more."
 gondor.0200.a:0 "And the tower guard shall take up the call..."

 ### FARAMIR EVENTS ###
 gondor.0300.t:0 "The Rangers of Ithilien"
 gondor.0300.desc:0 "The younger son of the Steward Denethor is a man in the mold of Numenor of old; kind, compassionate, learned and wise, yet not without skill in arms. Faramir would rather he never had to bear a sword, preferring the tales of yore and the library to any warsong and battlefield. Yet in these dwindling days, all sons of Gondor must fight for her safety, and Faramir has taken up his burden gladly to defend the last cities of the sons of Numenor. While Boromir leads the men of Gondor openly as Captain of the White Tower, Faramir's task is more subtle, but just as important. As their Captain, he leads the Ithilien Rangers, the forward-guard of Gondor. From the trees do his mens strike, harassing and hampering the forces of the Enemy. Many a force has been ended before Boromir's brave forces could ever face them by Faramir's solemn watch. \n\nBut a day will soon come when Faramir may be asked to burden an inheritance he never dreamed or feared would be his."

 ### DOL AMROTH EVENTS ###
 gondor.0400.t:0 "The Princedom of Dol Amroth"
 gondor.0400.desc:0 "Since the days of Numenor of old, the line of Imrazôr has flew their banner from the spires of proud Dol Amroth. It is said that Imrazôr took to wed Mithrellas, one of the companions of Nimrodel, and that the eldar-blood runs still in the veins of the Princes. Whatever the truth, none can deny the bearing and long nobility of the line of the Princes of Belfalas, whom have borne that title since the days of Elendil. \n\nThe Princes of Dol Amroth are second in dignity and honor in Gondor only to the Kings and the Stewards, and their princedom has endured where other mighty ones have fallen into decay and destruction. Their pride and joy are their knights, in whom some of the strength of Numenor still endures, and the thunder of the hooves of Dol Amroth have set many a foe to flight. \n\nIn these days of dwindling might and growing dread, Gondor leans ever-more on her mightiest princes. The line of Imrazôr shall not fail their duty."
 gondor.0400.a:0 "Forth, Knights of the Silver Swan!"

 ### RETURN OF THE KING EVENTS ###
 gondor.0500.t:0 "The Return of the King"
 gondor.0500.desc:0 "For many generations, the Throne of Gondor has sat absent, since King Eärnur disappeared into Minas Ithil in 2050 T.A. While the Stewards have served nobly in their absence, the lack of a King has been a gaping wound in the Kingdom that no amount of faithful service might heal. The people lose faith, and the Shadow in the East grows bold, testing the borders of Gondor. \n\nMany years ago I served the noble steward Ecthelion under the name Thorongil. I lead an assault on the havens of Umbar, burning the Corsair fleets. But now Gondor is assaulted on all sides, not only from sea, and it is a King, not a captain, which Gondor needs. \n\nThe blood of Elendil cannot stand aside while his people bleed. If a King I must be, then so be it."
 gondor.0500.a:0 "Gondor shall endure."
 
 gondor.0501.t:0 "The Return of the King"
 gondor.0501.desc:0 "A man, tall and grim, has ridden out of the north, seeking in your audience. At first, scrutinizing him, you are struck with a sense of familiarity. And suddenly it strikes you. Though his hair has grown longer, and a slight graying of his black hair, Thorongil, who served your father, stands before you. \n\nHe announces he comes to claim his birthright, before presenting his claim. He names himself Aragorn II, son of Arathorn, chieftain of the Dunedain of Arnor, the heir of Isildur son of Elendil. To prove his claim, he presents the sword Anduril, which he says is the reforged Narsil, which cut the ring from Sauron's finger. He shows also the ring of Barahir which was borne out of Numenor, and the testimony of the Elves of Rivendell and his northern kin who accompany him. There can be little doubt that he says the truth. \n\nOnce the Council of Gondor had rejected such a claim of the Northern Kingdom, but the line of Anarion is spent and no more. What says the steward of Gondor?"
 gondor.0501.a:0 "Long have the stewards awaited this hour. Gondor welcomes her king."
 gondor.0501.b:0 "Gondor has no kings. Gondor needs no kings."
 
 gondor.0502.t:0 "The Return of the King"
 gondor.0502.desc:0 "With great solemnity, the Steward of Gondor proclaims the credentials of Aragorn before the Great Gate and asks the people if they shall take him for their king. With a great shout the people and lords of Gondor reply yes. At this, the Steward gives a small smile, and with a low bow, surrender his staff of office to Aragorn, proclaiming the service of the stewards at last fulfilled. \n\nAfter accepting it, Aragorn bids the steward rise, and returns to him his staff of office, saying that the leal service of the House of Húrin shall not been forgotten, and that he confirms the position of Steward to his line so long as the heirs of Elendil endures."
 gondor.0502.a:0 "I will protect my people."
 
 gondor.0503.t:0 "The Return of the King"
 gondor.0503.desc:0 "The steward flatly refuses to acknowledge the claim of Aragorn. The line of Isildur, if it be not broken, is long bereft of lordship, and unfit to rule so mighty a people. \n\nHowever, it would appear the people do not agree. News of the events at the citadel have leaked from displeased guardsmen, and soon the city is in a furor over this betrayal by the Ruling Stewards. Soon too the Lords of Gondor have heard, and they also are wroth at this percieved dereliction of their oaths and duties. \n\nThe garrison of Minas Tirith has openly revolted, and imprisoned the Steward in the White Tower. The lords of Gondor have rode with all haste to Minas Tirith, and there sworn their loyalty to the King. \n\nThe days of the Stewards have ended, not in dignity, but in disgrace."
 gondor.0503.a:0 "Aragorn enters Minas Tirith."
 
 gondor.0504.t:0 "Elessar or Aragorn?"
 gondor.0504.desc:0 "In the days of old, it was the way of the Numenorean kings to take their names in Quenya. Though this practice has long since passed, I could revive it. The people have taken to calling me the ELfstone - perhaps that would be a fitting name for a king? There are event a scant few that are pushing me towards taking up a name in Adunaic."
 gondor.0504.a:0 "Tar-Elessar it shall be, a scion of Elros."
 gondor.0504.b:0 "Aragorn I have been, and Aragorn will I remain."
 gondor.0504.c:0 "Ar-Nimruzimir it shall be, for the sons of Numenor"
 
 gondor.0505.t:0 "A New House for a New Age?"
 gondor.0505.desc:0 "The line of Isildur, and of Elendil his father, at last sits once more in Minas Tirith. But a new age is dawning on us, a new Gondor. Shall I add another branch to the great tree of Elros, and begin a new royal house?"
 gondor.0505.a:0 "Strider I was in the wild, and I shall walk amongst my people. The house of Telcontar it shall be."
 gondor.0505.b:0 "Long has Isildur's line dwelled in darkness, and it cannot be forgotten. The house of Isildurionath we will remain."
 
 gondor.0506.t:0 "A Dream from Long Ago..."
 gondor.0506.desc:0 "I first met Arwen Evenstar when I was 20 in the gardens of Rivendell, and then named her Lúthien, for she was surely the most beautiful of all the living. On Cerin Amroth in Lórien did we swear to be bound, even under the shadow of the east and the twilight of the west. Through many trials now have I come, and the time has come to fulfill our promises to each other."
 gondor.0506.a:0 "Marry Arwen Evenstar."
 gondor.0506.b:0 "I cannot sunder her from her people, whatever grief should come for us."
 
 gondor.0507.t:0 " The Glory of Gondor Restored"
 gondor.0507.desc:0 "The King has at last returned to Gondor, and her people now rejoice. But a fell wind is upon the east, and the malice that was slowly building has now turned to fiery hate at the return of his oldest foe. Time shall tell if the King's return signals a new beginning... or an end."
 gondor.0507.a:0 "To whatever end..."
