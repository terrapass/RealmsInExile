 ### DENETHOR EVENTS ###
 gondor.0100.t:0 "The Steward of Gondor"
 gondor.0100.desc:0 "For twenty-five generations the Stewards of Gondor have kept a vigilant watch over the lands of Gondor, serving as its keepers and highest authority until the return of a rightful claimant to its kingship. Hardships—innumerable and often terrible, have come to pass during these times. There is no peace, for the men of Gondor can afford no such relief. Men are raised into soldiers instead of scholars; and iron is wrought into devices meant for war and nothing else.\n\nThe kingdom’s strength is waning. To the East a Great Shadow stirs. A nameless fear besieges the eastern shore. Patrols vanish without a word, and tradesmen are harried along the coasts. The decisive hour approaches, and for the kingdom of Gondor to endure it will need the likes Cirion or Ecthelion to lead its peoples.\n\nIn this hour, the burden lies upon the Steward Denethor II. He is a man loved by few, grim and stern by nature, often secluded in the White Tower. His bearing is as a king of old, shrewd and wise in his conduct and policy, and guided by his steely will Gondor has endured increasingly terrible odds. But a shadow is upon the heart of the steward, and as the long years of his watch lengthen, despair finds root within the whispering dark. \n\nUncertain, is the future of Gondor. It stands on a razor’s edge, and a single breeze could cast it down into the depths of darkness. But likewise, it could perhaps be restored to its former greatness just as quickly. Whatever might occur, in this moment the looming shadow moves ever-westward, encompassing all with its darkness and destruction..."

 ### BOROMIR EVENTS ###
 gondor.0200.t:0 "The Captain of Gondor"
 gondor.0200.desc:0 "For many years it has been a tradition for the heir to Gondor - either of the Kings or the Stewards - to serve as the Captain of the White Tower. These are the leader of the Citadel Guard, bearer of the Horn of Gondor, and head of the armies of Gondor after the Steward himself. No man was ever born more suited to the role than Boromir, elder son of the Steward Denethor. \n\nLoved and respected by his people and his men, Boromir is a man of the make of King Eärnur. Bearing great strength and valour, he is an honourable man, with a burning desire to see his people safe from the encroaching shadow. He is not a man much concerned with the old lore and wisdoms, save in the tales of old battles, and his zeal for his country may be yet his salvation or his damnation. \n\nTo the Captain of the White Tower Gondor looks, and upon him is its hope laid and remain, lest some hope unlooked for comes to rally the people once more."
 gondor.0200.a:0 "And the tower guard shall take up the call..."

 ### FARAMIR EVENTS ###
 gondor.0300.t:0 "The Rangers of Ithilien"
 gondor.0300.desc:0 "The younger son of the Steward Denethor is a man in the mould of Númenor of old; kind, compassionate, learned and wise, yet not without skill in arms. Faramir would rather he never had to bear a sword, preferring the tales of yore and the library to any war song and battlefield. Yet in these dwindling days, all sons of Gondor must fight for her safety, and Faramir has taken up his burden gladly to defend the last cities of the sons of Númenor. While Boromir leads the men of Gondor openly as Captain of the White Tower, Faramir's task is more subtle, but just as important. As their Captain, he leads the Ithilien Rangers, the forward-guard of Gondor. From the trees do his men strike, harassing and hampering the forces of the Enemy. Many a force has been ended before Boromir's brave forces could ever face them by Faramir's solemn watch. \n\nBut a day will soon come when Faramir may be asked to burden an inheritance he never dreamed or feared would be his."
 gondor.0300.a:0 "I do not love the bright sword for its sharpness..."

 gondor.0301.t:0 "The Second Son of Denethor"
 gondor.0301.desc:0 "Long have I been forced to endure the darkness of my father. He berates me and ignores my efforts no matter the magnitude of their success. Only my brother, Boromir, has been a source of kindness in my life. Should I, then, recommit myself to the peril at hand and focus my efforts on the defense of the kingdom, or shall I finally seek solace and affection long-needed in the arms of another?"
 gondor.0301.a:0 "Gondor and its people need me now more than ever."
 gondor.0301.a.tt:0 "A time for love shall come...
 gondor.0301.b:0 "Love and affection is all I have ever desired..."
 
 gondor.0302.t:0 "The Shieldmaiden of Rohan"
 gondor.0302.desc:0 "Whilst on a scouting mission along the western bank of the Anduin, I chance upon a lone Rohirric soldier riding through the fields. He is strong and obviously a master with both sword and bow, felling a deer from some fifty meters without issue. I remain hidden for a time as he skins and strips the deer of its meat and hide, but somehow I feel as though he knows I am watching. \n\nOnly after I am certain that he is done with his work do I dare approach, holding my hands up slightly to declare my peaceful intent. The man looks back at me, then squints from behind his helm... Something doesn't seem quite right with him up close. The armor he wears seems almost too big for him, and his eyes are even more radiant than before. \n\nWithout so much as a word, the soldier reaches up and pulls his helm from his head, revealing not the face of a rugged veteran of the Riddermark, but rather a maiden most fair. Her hair is long, spun like gold, and her skin is as pale and beautiful as the Winter snows. There is nothing that I can say that can possible explain how I feel; so pure and filled with wonderment that only my actions are surely enough. Is she, this Shieldmaiden of Rohan, the one I have sought for all these years?"
 gondor.0302.a:0 "Love, sweet and filled with bliss, at last..."
 gondor.0302.b:0 "She is but a common Rohirric woman. Marry her I cannot."
 
 gondor.0303.t:0 "The Shieldmaiden of Rohan"
 gondor.0303.desc:0 "There is more news from the White City, my lord. After assuming his kingship, the new High King Aragorn has also decided to make a Rohirric Shieldmaiden his queen. Though most are skeptical of this choice, her apparent skill with both sword and lance is almost without equal. With these good tidings, perhaps it is time for you to finally consider a marriage of your own?"
 gondor.0303.a:0 "Yes, it was foolish of me to wait this long."


 ### DOL AMROTH EVENTS ###
 gondor.0400.t:0 "The Princedom of Dol Amroth"
 gondor.0400.desc:0 "Since the days of Númenor of old, the line of Imrazôr has flew their banner from the spires of proud Dol Amroth. It is said that Imrazôr took to wed Mithrellas, one of the companions of Nimrodel, and that the eldar-blood runs still in the veins of the Princes. Whatever the truth, none can deny the bearing and long nobility of the line of the Princes of Belfalas, who have borne that title since the days of Elendil. \n\nThe Princes of Dol Amroth are second in dignity and honour in Gondor only to the Kings and the Stewards, and their princedom has endured where other mighty ones have fallen into decay and destruction. Their pride and joy are their knights, in whom some of the strength of Númenor still endures, and the thunder of the hooves of Dol Amroth have set many a foe to flight. \n\nIn these days of dwindling might and growing dread, Gondor leans ever-more on her mightiest princes. The line of Imrazôr shall not fail their duty."
 gondor.0400.a:0 "Forth, Knights of the Silver Swan!"
 swan_knights_force:0 "Knights of the Swan"
 
 gondor.0401.t:0 "The Order of the Swan"
 gondor.0401.desc:0 "Silver, glimmering and gleaming silver armaments of war. Great winged helms and long cloaks of blue, a Knight of Dol Amroth is a sight to behold, lance held high and chin even higher, dignity renewed. \n\nThis is what the rest of the world sees in the knights of Dor-en-Ernil, but only one in the Order itself knows the truth. Chivalry is dead, replaced by bribery and bloodlines and every other misfortune of men. If the Order of the Swan is to be reformed then the reformer certainly has his work cut out for him. The Amrothian Reserves will need to be expanded; the old oaths of Edhellond upheld; the Sea-ward regiments will need to be made anew again; and the ancient Order of the Tirith Aear must be reforged. Only after these things are completed can the Princes of Dol-Amroth reclaim their honor. A new order - that of the Silver Swan - shall rise in the old order's place."  
 gondor.0401.a:0 "There is much work to be done."
 
  gondor.0402.t:0 "The Amrothian Reserves"
  gondor.0402.desc:0 "For years relugated to being the most humble of positions within the Order of the Swan, the Amrothian soldiery has in many ways been the group which have maintained the true spirit of the original Order the best. However, in spite of this, their ranks have been sadly depleted, the role viewed as lacking in honor and splendor and thus neglected. \n\nLet us work on restoring this backbone of our forces to their proper fighting strength."
  gondor.0402.a:0 "Sound the trumpets! Let every man know of his prince's need!"
  
  gondor.0403.t:0 "Amrothian Reserves Recruited"
  gondor.0403.desc:0 "In response to their lord's call, the men of Dol Amroth, from commoner to noble, have proven themselves worthy of great esteem. They have put their social ranks aside to fight side by side in the Amrothian soldiery, training long and enduring great discomforts. \n\nThese soldiers form the backbone of our elite forces, and let none gainsay their honor or their courage! We shall ensure they are properly honored for their dedication and sacrifice."
  gondor.0403.a:0 "Wonderful news! Have the men form up in the courtyard!"
  amrothian_reserves:0 "Amrothian Reserves" 
  
  gondor.0404.t:0 "The Men of Edhellond"
  gondor.0404.desc:0 "Edhellond, once-home of the Elven domain of the same name, is one of the noblest and richest governates of Dor-en-Ernil. They strive to emulate Elven tactics in warfare, in contrast with the rest of Gondor, who maintain a firm martial tradition inherited from the days of Númenor. Their ranks amongst the Order have sat empty, oaths unsaid as the rot festered within the organization. We must make anew our oaths of old. \n\nIf they could be reintegrated into the armies of the Prince, they could serve as a powerful and innovative contingent."
  gondor.0404.a:0 "Send our fastest rider to gather the men!"
  
  gondor.0405.t:0 "The Arrival of the Men of Edhellond"
  gondor.0405.desc:0 "In response to the Prince's summons, the men of Edhellond have arrived, bearing their greatbows and fine horses. The Nimrodel rangers, based on traditions of the Sindar, form the largest part of their contingent, but they are accompanied by the Knights of Edhellond as well. Uniquely amongst Gondor, these knights make use of bow and arrow while riding horseback, allowing them to to brutally harass the enemy without ever risking themselves in a charge. \n\nThe Prince's armies have been much ennobled by their addition."
  gondor.0405.a:0 "They shall serve as an example for the rest of us."
  edhellond_soldiers:0 "Soldiers of Edhellond"
  
  gondor.0406.t:0 "The Sea-ward Regiments"
  gondor.0406.desc:0 "Once the Dor-en-Ernil equal to the mighty marines of Pelargir, the Sea-ward regiments fought on the high seas and the coasts, besting corsairs and winning high honors. However, as Pelargir has risen in prominence as the heart of the Royal Navy, this guard division has dwindled to a skeleton force, maintaining a few coastal lookouts at most. \n\nIf we could expand them once more, they would once again serve us well as fearsome shock-troops."
  gondor.0406.a:0 "Begin the training at once!"
  
  gondor.0407.t:0 "The Sea-ward Regiments Expanded"
  gondor.0407.desc:0 "Wielding great two-handed blades, the Sea-ward regiments are at least beginning to resemble their days of glory. Bearing heavy platemail and mighty swords, these shining heavy infantry can break even the hardiest enemy lines. \n\nWith them regaining their strength, Dol Amroth can begin to once again project power over the seas, and our shoreline has never been better defended."

  gondor.0408.t:0 "Reforging the Oathkeepers of Tirith-Aear"
  gondor.0408.desc:0 "The Tirith-Aear, or 'Sea-ward Tower' in Sindarin, is the great tower of Dor-en-Ernil, once built by the Elves dwelling within the region. The name has also become that of the elite guard units which protect the tower, the Oathkeepers of Tirith-Aear, the most elite of the Sea-ward troops. Required to swear oaths of virtue and valor, these wardens should be of unimpeacheable character. But of all the classes of the old Order, this one rotted most, with the position being given on account of blood, not valor. It will require great effort to rebuild it to its former glory. \n\nWe shall begin by dismissing those of the order known to be corrupt, and then begin searching for those worthy of this great honor."
  gondor.0408.a:0 "Select only the finest soldiers for the honor of taking the oaths."
  
  gondor.0409.t:0 "The Oaths Reforged"
  gondor.0409.desc:0 "Though it has taken no small amount of political wrangling to dismiss corrupt members of the order, at last the Oathkeepers are starting to resemble a group worthy of their name. The new members take their oaths incredibly seriously, the image of knightly valor and virtue. \n\nWith them on guard, the Tirith-Aear is well guarded, and shall never fall."
  gondor.0409.a:0 "They shall be the envy of Gondor."

  gondor.0410.t:0 "Reform the Royal Swan-guard"
  gondor.0410.desc:0 "The elite of the elite, the Royal Swan Guard are tasked with defending the Prince of Dol Amroth at all hours of the day. In times of war they gladly follow him into battle, and should the need arise, they would give their lives for their prince without hesitation. \n\nNo longer shall politics determine appointment to this most hallowed of orders! Only those of purest heart and greatest valor shall be allowed to join its august ranks."
  gondor.0410.a:0 "Virtue inherent, only the purest of heart shall be given the honour."
  
  gondor.0411.t:0 "The Order of the Silver Swan"
  gondor.0411.desc:0 "The epitome of Númenórean valor, the Royal Order of the Silver Swan is an image of the nobility of Men at the height of their virtue. Of unmatched moral fibre and great skill in arms, only a select few are ever counted amongst this most hallowed order. To be offered such a chance is accounted an honor beyond price in the lands of Dol Amroth, and few refuse it, for it is both a great honor and a crushing duty. \n\nWith these handpicked warriors, paragons of valor and skill, the Prince has nothing to fear, for he is guarded by the most capable men in all of Dor-en-Ernil."
  gondor.0411.a:0 "Such magnificence hasn't been seen in centuries."

 ### RETURN OF THE KING EVENTS ###
 gondor.0500.t:0 "The Return of the King"
 gondor.0500.desc:0 "For many generations, the Throne of Gondor has sat absent, since King Eärnur disappeared into Minas Ithil in 2050 T.A. While the Stewards have served nobly in their absence, the lack of a King has been a gaping wound in the Kingdom that no amount of faithful service might heal. The people lose faith, and the Shadow in the East grows bold, testing the borders of Gondor. \n\nMany years ago, I served the noble steward Ecthelion under the name Thorongil. I lead an assault on the havens of Umbar, burning the Corsair fleets. But now Gondor is assaulted on all sides, not only from sea, and it is a King, not a captain, which Gondor needs. \n\nThe blood of Elendil cannot stand aside while his people bleed. If a King I must be, then so be it."
 gondor.0500.a:0 "Gondor shall endure."
 
 gondor.0501.t:0 "The Return of the King"
 gondor.0501.desc:0 "A man, tall and grim, has ridden out of the north, seeking in your audience. At first, scrutinizing him, you are struck with a sense of familiarity. And suddenly it strikes you. Though his hair has grown longer, and a slight greying of his black hair, Thorongil, who served your father, stands before you. \n\nHe announces he comes to claim his birthright, before presenting his claim. He names himself Aragorn II, son of Arathorn, chieftain of the Dúnedain of Arnor, the heir of Isildur son of Elendil. To prove his claim, he presents the sword Anduril, which he says is the reforged Narsil, which cut the ring from Sauron's finger. He shows also the ring of Barahir which was borne out of Númenor, and the testimony of the Elves of Rivendell and his northern kin who accompany him. There can be little doubt that he says the truth. \n\nOnce the Council of Gondor had rejected such a claim of the Northern Kingdom, but the line of Anarion is spent and no more. What says the steward of Gondor?"
 gondor.0501.a:0 "Long have the stewards awaited this hour. Gondor welcomes her king."
 gondor.0501.b:0 "Gondor has no kings. Gondor needs no kings."
 
 gondor.0502.t:0 "The Return of the King"
 gondor.0502.desc:0 "To the great acclaim of the people, the King has ridden into Minas Tirith. The people and lords rejoice for this unlooked for blessing, and already a fervent feeling of the tide turning has gripped the city. Minstrels furiously compose new pieces, loremasters speak of the King's ancient lineage and his proud bearing, and the people have doubled their effort to make the city as beautiful as it ever was. Those who remember Thorongil of the North whisper the King and the great hero are one and the same. \n\nAt long last, the seat of the Kings is no longer empty, and Gondor begins to rose itself from its long, lethargic rest. A new age is dawning, it is heard on the wind and felt in the earth. \n\nThe days of the King have come at last, and may they be blessed."
 gondor.0502.a:0 "I will protect my people."
 
 gondor.0503.t:0 "The Defiance of the Steward"
 gondor.0503.desc:0 "The steward flatly refuses to acknowledge the claim of Aragorn. The line of Isildur, if it be not broken, is long bereft of lordship, and unfit to rule so mighty a people. \n\nHowever, it would appear the people do not agree. News of the events at the citadel have leaked from displeased guardsmen, and soon the city is in a furore over this betrayal by the Ruling Stewards. Soon, the Lords of Gondor have heard of this, and they also are wroth at this perceived dereliction of their oaths and duties. \n\nThe garrison of Minas Tirith has openly revolted and imprisoned the Steward in the White Tower. The lords of Gondor have ridden with all haste to Minas Tirith, and there sworn their loyalty to the King. \n\nThe days of the Stewards have ended, not in dignity, but in disgrace."
 gondor.0503.a:0 "So passes the rule of Húrin's line."

 
 gondor.0504.t:0 "Elessar or Aragorn?"
 gondor.0504.desc:0 "In the days of old, it was the way of the Númenórean kings to take their names in Quenya. Though this practice has long since passed, I could revive it. The people have taken to calling me the Elfstone - perhaps that would be a fitting name for a king? There are event a scant few that are pushing me towards taking up a name in Adunaic."

 gondor.0513.a:0 "Her name will be Indis."
 
 gondor.0514.t:0 "The Final Pregnancy"
 gondor.0514.desc:0 "Once more the Queen is pregnant, but the King and Queen seem to think this may be the last. They will not say why to those that ask them, but they seem assured in this fact, and so the court busies itself preparing for another royal birth - perhaps the last of this generation."

 gondor.0515.desc:0 "In appearance, the new princess is as her sister, bearing calm serenity and piercing bright eyes that drink in everything around her. Queen Arwen quips that she's reminded of her grandmother's unnerving gaze, and after faltering a moment, the King recovers and agrees with a laugh. It seems even just the memory of the anger of the Lady Galadriel is enough to make such a mighty King stumble. What name shall she bear, this final child of the King and Queen?"
 gondor.0515.a:0 "Her name will be Altáriel."

 gondor.0517.desc:0 "In a grand ceremony in Minas Tirith, Aragorn II, heir of Isildur and chieftain of the Dúnedain of Arnor has been proclaimed King of Gondor, High-King of the Dúnedain-in-exile, Lord of the West. He has proven his identity beyond all doubt, bearing Andúril, Narsil reforged, and his claim has been accepted by the lords and people of Gondor. \n\nIn his youth he was Thorongil, the Eagle of the Star, and in Gondor and Rohan alike that name served with valour and distinction. The people of Gondor have not forgotten their great Captain, now returned at an hour unexpected, and their joy is bright as the sun in summer. \n\nIt is a happening unlooked for by the peoples of the south, the line of Isildur long ago deemed dead and gone. Yet already a change in the winds can be felt, a people's will ringing upon the waves and silver trumpets proclaiming their defiance. Gondor, long lethargic, stirs from its stupor and seems to be regaining its long-fading strength. \n\nGondor's allies rejoice, while those that are set against the Dúnedain have been seized with a great terror and despair, foreseeing in the return of the King their doom."

 gondor.1000.desc:0 "For many years, Harondor has slowly slipped away from the control of Gondor, the Haradrim gaining evermore power therein and pushing the Dúnedain from their lands. Now at last the tide has been reversed, and the province fully reclaimed. \n\nLet it be said Harondor is a contested land no longer - Gondor has reclaimed her own!"

 gondor.1001.desc:0 "In a grand proclamation, the royal authorities in Gondor have proclaimed that the Province of Harondor has been fully reclaimed at long last. They promise that they shall exert every effort to restore the province's eroded infrastructure and to rebuild the economy of the war-torn province. Many have begun to question if this is the herald of a larger Gondorian reconquest of other lost territories. \n\nWhatever else, nobody can now deny that Gondor has a firm grip over Harondor now."
 gondor.1001.a:0 "Congratulations are in order for Minas Tirith."
 gondor.1001.b:0 "Damn them! They have no right to that land, colonizers and usurpers!"

 ### OATH OF EORL EVENTS ###
 
 gondor.2000.t:0 "The Oath of Cirion"
 gondor.2000.desc:0 "A rider has arrived at Minas Tirith from Edoras, seeking an emergency audience with the Lord of the White Tower. After being ushered in, he cuts immediately to the point – Rohan is hard pressed by its foes, and calls upon Gondor to aid her, as both sides swore in the days of Eorl and Cirion. Many times has the oath been called upon by both sides, and the few times it has not been fulfilled was due to both kingdoms simultaneously facing attacks.\n\nWhat does the White Tower bid this messenger of the Horse-lords? Does Gondor stand with her Northern ally?"
 gondor.2000.a:0 "Our nations are as father and son. And a father looks after his own."
 gondor.2000.b:0 "An army in the style of the Northern Army of old shall be dispatched."
 gondor.2000.c:0 "Send a battalion of our men to reinforce the Riddermark."
 gondor.2000.d:0 "We are too thin-stretched... Regrettably, Rohan will have to wait for now."

 gondor.2001.desc:0 "“Horns, horns, horns, in dark Mindolluin's sides they dimly echoed. Great horns of the north wildly blowing. Rohan had come at last.” \n\nIn response to our call, the Rohirrim have answered in full. Even now, their mighty horns can be heard blasting in the hills and the earth trembles at the approach of their great cavalry. Eorl’s heirs have not forgotten Gondor, nor their oath, and ride now to our aid in the fullness of their might.\n\nUnited in our great struggle, the valour of Gondor and Rohan shall withstand all those who seek to destroy them."
 gondor.2001.a:0 "Hope is kindled."

 gondor.2002.t:0 "The Riders of Rohan"
 gondor.2002.desc:0 "A host has arrived from Rohan to aid us in our war. While they cannot spare the fullness of their army to assist us, the Rohirrim have sent a strong army, well equipped, and led by one of their foremost lords.\n\nAlready discussions have begun on how best to utilize the Rohirrim’s powerful cavalry in the battles to come, and how best to supply them now that they are here in Gondor. But such problems are trifling in the face of the arrival of dear friends and old allies to aid us.\n\nWith their cavalry guarding our flank and smashing into the enemies’ rear, our situation seems no longer quite so dire."
 gondor.2002.a:0 "We will not forget their loyalty and friendship."

 gondor.2003.t:0 "Auxiliaries of Rohan"
 gondor.2003.desc:0 "The Rohirrim have sent auxiliaries to aid us in our battle. Rugged and effective, these troops are few in number but make for it in their zeal and fighting spirit. They have already begun to be employed as very effective scouting parties and have managed to launch some effective ambushes in coordination with our own forward captains.\n\nWhile we would have liked more, the Rohirrim envoys say that more men simply cannot be spared at this time. We shall make do with the men we have, and the Rohirrim sending even this small amount is a reminder that we are not alone in our fight, nor without friends in the wider world."
 gondor.2003.a:0 "Some men are better than none."

 gondor.2004.t:0 "Where now the Horse and the Rider?"
 gondor.2004.desc:0 "We sent the rider bearing the Red Arrow weeks ago, but he has only now returned, sadly disappointed. It is apparent on his face that no aid shall come from the Horse-lords.\n\nIn explanation, he says that the Horse-lords have claimed to be too hard-pressed in their own affairs to offer any aid to Gondor at the moment – but that they will not forget Gondor, and once they are able shall send forces to aid us in our wars. Of course, by such a time, our own war might well have finished."
 gondor.2004.a:0 "It is understandable, but regrettable."
 
 ### Destroy Mordor ###
 gondor.2100.t:0 "The Final Battle"
 gondor.2100.desc:0 "For too long has the Dark Lord in his black tower been a blight upon the sons of Númenor! We know no rest and no peace, our defenses always tested. Our sons bleed, and our children wail in fear. Well, no longer! Gondor shall no quail in fear, but march forward with our heads held high. We shall snuff out the Dark Lord, root and stem, and make of his land such a desolation that never again shall he be able to raise it anew. \n\nI see in your eyes the same fear that would take the heart of me! A day may come, when the courage of Men fails! When we forsake our friends and break all bonds of fellowship. But it is not this day! An hour of wolves and shattered shields, as the Age of Men comes crashing down! But it is not this day. By all that you hold dear, on this good earth..."
 gondor.2100.a:0 "...I bid you stand, Men of the West!"
 gondor.2100.a.tt:0 "Whatever shall come, let no one say the men of Númenor quailed in fear and chose despair. Here at the end, let us grasp hope, even if it be folly."
 
 gondor.2101.t:0 "The Gondorian Assault"
 gondor.2101.desc:0 "Gondor has decided to make a full assault on our realm, desiring to destroy us utterly. Alreading they are marching through Ithilien towards Minas Ithil, and will soon enter Gorgoroth."
 gondor.2101.a:0 "The arrogance... let us humble Gondor."
 
 gondor.2102.t:0 "The Black Tower Falls"
 gondor.2102.desc:0 "Though it came at great price, at last Mordor is broken beneath the fury of the Dúnedain. The deaths of Eärnur, Elendil, Isildur, and the destruction of Númenor itself are at last avenged, for the Dark Lord is banished, his form upon this plane eviscerated. His mighty tower has crumbled without his will to support it, and his armies have fled in terror before the fury of the West. It is a deed thought impossible through force of arms, but the Dúnedain have done what their Númenórean forefathers could not, and at last unmade the works of Sauron, root and stem. \n\nA new age is dawning upon Middle-Earth, one of the triumphant West and the Tree and the Sceptre reunited once more. Long shall this memory endure, while the thrones of the Valar endure."
 gondor.2102.a:0 "But is evil ever truly ended, in Arda Marred?"
 
 gondor.2103.t:0 "The Lidless Eye Closes"
 gondor.2103.desc:0 "In a shocking display of strength of arms, the forces of Gondor have marched on Mordor, sacking the Dark Tower and felling the Dark Lord in the heart of his power. The Dark Tower, deprived of its master, swiftly collapsed, devastating the area. \n\nIn the aftermath of the great battle, whatever unity there was in the Dark Lord's domain swiftly began to unravel. Their leadership decapitated, the former servants of the Dark Lord have quickly begun to turn on each other, orc and man, signaling a new era of warfare in the former lands of Sauron. \n\nSimultaneously, the loss of their god has caused a severe crisis of faith for the followers of the Lidless Eye. Many swiftly turned away to other faiths, and the few that were left quickly tore each other apart jockeying for power. The Cult of the Lidless Eye, once pre-eminent faith in Mordor and all Sauron's dominions, has been all but extinguished in the aftermath. \n\nA new age is upon us, one which seems like it shall be dominated by a resurgent kingdom of the Dúnedain. Whatever else, the power of Mordor is broken irrevocably, perhaps forever."
 gondor.2103.a:0 "Dawn is breaking, the Shadow is passing."
 
 ###Fate of Isildur###
 gondor.2201.t:0 "The Fate of Isildur"
 gondor.2201.desc:0 "Upon opening the great steel case, only two items are held within. Firstly, a chain with a small golden box attached, designed to be worn around the neck. The box has a fine velvet setting within, designed to hold a ring - and it is then that the realization dawns upon the expedition, for this must assuredly be the necklace with which Isildur held the Ruling Ring, after he cut it from the hand of Sauron himself.\n\nNext, however, is the greater prize. A golden cylinder, without marking or ornamentation, rests upon a fine silver pillow. Once it is opened, an audible gasp rises. Attached to a chain of mithril and glowing with an ancient light, a great jewel inlaid in gold and mithril is contained within. This is the Elendilmir, the Star of Elendil, Star of the North Kingdom, borne out of Numenor ere it fell and a heirloom of the northern kingdom. It was lost with Isildur, and since then the Kings of Arnor wore the Lesser Elendilmir, a replica made in its image by the Elves of Imladris. \n\nWith these artifacts, the ultimate fate of Isildur is now made clear. It appears his corpse was uncovered by Saruman in his many years of searching for the One, and he stripped it of all its treasures. He then burned the body, in order to remove all traces of Isildur's whereabouts, to slow all who were attempting to uncover the One Ring.\n\nSo now the tale of Isildur can be written in full, both his valor and his failings. Though he fell and his last great choice came to ruin, we must not allow that to diminish his many noble acts, for there is more to a story than its ending."
 gondor.2201.a:0 "Rest in peace, son of Numenor!"

###Search the Orthanc###
 gondor.2200.t:0 "Search the Orthanc"
 gondor.2200.desc:0 "Isengard has sat without a proper key-bearer for far too long. After Saruman established himself within, the Dunedain swiftly lost all insight into the inner-goings of the great tower. Now, with Saruman's treachery revealed and the tower reclaimed, an accounting is in order of what he may have hidden within.\n\nThe first major discovery is an immense store of food of incomparable quality, befitting a king's table - salted pork, fine wines, fowl of every sort of game, potatoes of finest stock, and many other fine delicacies. Most surprising, however, is the discovering of several barrels filled absolutely to the brim with Longbottom Leaf! This leaf is the highest quality in the known world, grown in the southfarthing of the Shire. It is costly to import from out of the Shire, as Bree is usually the only place such deals can be made. It is well known the White Wizard had scornfully referred to Gandalf the Gray's habit of smoking pipeweed, but it seems behind closed doors he had indulged himself!\n\nAfter moving on, the search party continues its ascent of the tower. In Saruman's study amongst many tomes of lore and trinkets of unknown device, a hidden door was discovered disguised behind a tapestry. Within is a great steel case, with a heavy lock matching a key discovered with the Key of Orthanc. We could open in, but the pipeweed is calling..."
 gondor.2200.a:0 "Most curious... what could possibly be worth all this secrecy?"
 gondor.2200.b:0 "Longbottom Leaf? A prize fit for a king, bring me a pipe!"
