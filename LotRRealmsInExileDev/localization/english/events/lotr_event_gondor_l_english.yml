 ### DENETHOR EVENTS ###
 gondor.0100.t:0 "The Steward of Gondor"
 gondor.0100.desc:0 "For twenty-five generations the Stewards of Gondor have kept a vigilant watch over the lands of Gondor, serving as its keepers and highest authority until the return of a rightful claimant to its kingship. Hardships—innumerable and often terrible, have come to pass during these times. There is no peace, for the men of Gondor can afford no such relief. Men are raised into soldiers instead of scholars; and iron is wrought into devices meant for war and nothing else.\n\nThe kingdom’s strength in waning. To the East a Great Shadow stirs. A nameless fear besieges the eastern shore. Patrols vanish without a word, and tradesmen are harried along the coasts. The decisive hour approaches, and for the kingdom of Gondor to endure it will need the likes Cirion or Ecthelion to lead its peoples.\n\nAlas, then, that these dark days should fall upon the vindictive Steward Denethor. He is a man loved by few and distrusted by many. And although the early days of his rule boded well for the kingdom’s future, the sudden death of his wife Finduilas wracked him greatly. Grief-stricken, he is silent whenever command is needed; and he is grim whenever hope seems within grasp…\n\nUncertain, is the future of Gondor. It stands on a razor’s edge, and a single breeze could cast it down into the depths of darkness. But likewise, it could perhaps be restored to its former greatness just as quickly. Whatever might occur, in this moment the looming shadow moves ever-westward, encompassing all with its darkness and destruction..."
