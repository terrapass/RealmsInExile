 ### DENETHOR EVENTS ###
 gondor.0100.t:0 "The Steward of Gondor"
 gondor.0100.desc:0 "For twenty-five generations the Stewards of Gondor have kept a vigilant watch over the lands of Gondor, serving as its keepers and highest authority until the return of a rightful claimant to its kingship. Hardships—innumerable and often terrible, have come to pass during these times. There is no peace, for the men of Gondor can afford no such relief. Men are raised into soldiers instead of scholars; and iron is wrought into devices meant for war and nothing else.\n\nThe kingdom’s strength is waning. To the East a Great Shadow stirs. A nameless fear besieges the eastern shore. Patrols vanish without a word, and tradesmen are harried along the coasts. The decisive hour approaches, and for the kingdom of Gondor to endure it will need the likes Cirion or Ecthelion to lead its peoples.\n\nIn this hour, the burden lies upon the Steward Denethor II. He is a man loved by few, grim and stern by nature, often secluded in the White Tower. His bearing is as a king of old, shrewd and wise in his conduct and policy, and guided by his steely will Gondor has endured increasingly terrible odds. But a shadow is upon the heart of the steward, and as the long years of his watch lengthen, despair finds root within the whispering dark. \n\nUncertain, is the future of Gondor. It stands on a razor’s edge, and a single breeze could cast it down into the depths of darkness. But likewise, it could perhaps be restored to its former greatness just as quickly. Whatever might occur, in this moment the looming shadow moves ever-westward, encompassing all with its darkness and destruction..."
 gondor.0100.a:0 "There is an Evil in Mordor that does not sleep."
 gondor.0100.a.tt:0 "We must prepare. He comes."
 
 ### BOROMIR EVENTS ###
 gondor.0200.t:0 "The Captain of Gondor"
 gondor.0200.desc:0 "For many years it has been a tradition for the heir to Gondor - either of the Kings or the Stewards - to serve as the Captain of the White Tower. These are the leader of the Citadel Guard, bearer of the Horn of Gondor, and head of the armies of Gondor after the Steward himself. No man was ever born more suited to the role than Boromir, elder son of the Steward Denethor. \n\nLoved and respected by his people and his men, Boromir is a man of the make of King Eärnur. Bearing great strength and valour, he is an honourable man, with a burning desire to see his people safe from the encroaching shadow. He is not a man much concerned with the old lore and wisdoms, save in the tales of old battles, and his zeal for his country may be yet his salvation or his damnation. \n\nTo the Captain of the White Tower Gondor looks, and upon him is its hope laid and remain, lest some hope unlooked for comes to rally the people once more."
 gondor.0200.a:0 "And the tower guard shall take up the call..."

 ### FARAMIR EVENTS ###
 gondor.0300.t:0 "The Rangers of Ithilien"
 gondor.0300.desc:0 "The younger son of the Steward Denethor is a man in the mould of Númenor of old; kind, compassionate, learned and wise, yet not without skill in arms. Faramir would rather he never had to bear a sword, preferring the tales of yore and the library to any war song and battlefield. Yet in these dwindling days, all sons of Gondor must fight for her safety, and Faramir has taken up his burden gladly to defend the last cities of the sons of Númenor. While Boromir leads the men of Gondor openly as Captain of the White Tower, Faramir's task is more subtle, but just as important. As their Captain, he leads the Ithilien Rangers, the forward-guard of Gondor. From the trees do his men strike, harassing and hampering the forces of the Enemy. Many a force has been ended before Boromir's brave forces could ever face them by Faramir's solemn watch. \n\nBut a day will soon come when Faramir may be asked to burden an inheritance he never dreamed or feared would be his."
 gondor.0300.a:0 "I do not love the bright sword for its sharpness..."

 gondor.0301.t:0 "The Second Son of Denethor"
 gondor.0301.desc:0 "Long have I been forced to endure the darkness of my father. He berates me and ignores my efforts no matter the magnitude of their success. Only my brother, Boromir, has been a source of kindness in my life. Should I, then, recommit myself to the peril at hand and focus my efforts on the defense of the kingdom, or shall I finally seek solace and affection long-needed in the arms of another?"
 gondor.0301.a:0 "Gondor and its people need me now more than ever."
 gondor.0301.a.tt:0 "A time for love shall come...
 gondor.0301.b:0 "Love and affection is all I have ever desired..."

 
 ### DOL AMROTH EVENTS ###
 gondor.0400.t:0 "The Princedom of Dol Amroth"
 gondor.0400.desc:0 "Since the days of Númenor of old, the line of Imrazôr has flew their banner from the spires of proud Dol Amroth. It is said that Imrazôr took to wed Mithrellas, one of the companions of Nimrodel, and that the eldar-blood runs still in the veins of the Princes. Whatever the truth, none can deny the bearing and long nobility of the line of the Princes of Belfalas, who have borne that title since the days of Elendil. \n\nThe Princes of Dol Amroth are second in dignity and honour in Gondor only to the Kings and the Stewards, and their princedom has endured where other mighty ones have fallen into decay and destruction. Their pride and joy are their knights, in whom some of the strength of Númenor still endures, and the thunder of the hooves of Dol Amroth have set many a foe to flight. \n\nIn these days of dwindling might and growing dread, Gondor leans ever-more on her mightiest princes. The line of Imrazôr shall not fail their duty."
 gondor.0400.a:0 "Forth, Knights of the Silver Swan!"

 ### RETURN OF THE KING EVENTS ###
 gondor.0500.t:0 "The Return of the King"
 gondor.0500.desc:0 "For many generations, the Throne of Gondor has sat absent, since King Eärnur disappeared into Minas Ithil in 2050 T.A. While the Stewards have served nobly in their absence, the lack of a King has been a gaping wound in the Kingdom that no amount of faithful service might heal. The people lose faith, and the Shadow in the East grows bold, testing the borders of Gondor. \n\nMany years ago, I served the noble steward Ecthelion under the name Thorongil. I lead an assault on the havens of Umbar, burning the Corsair fleets. But now Gondor is assaulted on all sides, not only from sea, and it is a King, not a captain, which Gondor needs. \n\nThe blood of Elendil cannot stand aside while his people bleed. If a King I must be, then so be it."
 gondor.0500.a:0 "Gondor shall endure."
 
 gondor.0501.t:0 "The Return of the King"
 gondor.0501.desc:0 "A man, tall and grim, has ridden out of the north, seeking in your audience. At first, scrutinizing him, you are struck with a sense of familiarity. And suddenly it strikes you. Though his hair has grown longer, and a slight greying of his black hair, Thorongil, who served your father, stands before you. \n\nHe announces he comes to claim his birthright, before presenting his claim. He names himself Aragorn II, son of Arathorn, chieftain of the Dúnedain of Arnor, the heir of Isildur son of Elendil. To prove his claim, he presents the sword Anduril, which he says is the reforged Narsil, which cut the ring from Sauron's finger. He shows also the ring of Barahir which was borne out of Númenor, and the testimony of the Elves of Rivendell and his northern kin who accompany him. There can be little doubt that he says the truth. \n\nOnce the Council of Gondor had rejected such a claim of the Northern Kingdom, but the line of Anarion is spent and no more. What says the steward of Gondor?"
 gondor.0501.a:0 "Long have the stewards awaited this hour. Gondor welcomes her king."
 gondor.0501.b:0 "Gondor has no kings. Gondor needs no kings."
 
 gondor.0502.t:0 "The Return of the King"
 gondor.0502.desc:0 "To the great acclaim of the people, the King has ridden into Minas Tirith. The people and lords rejoice for this unlooked for blessing, and already a fervent feeling of the tide turning has gripped the city. Minstrels furiously compose new pieces, loremasters speak of the King's ancient lineage and his proud bearing, and the people have doubled their effort to make the city as beautiful as it ever was. Those who remember Thorongil of the North whisper the King and the great hero are one and the same. \n\nAt long last, the seat of the Kings is no longer empty, and Gondor begins to rose itself from its long, lethargic rest. A new age is dawning, it is heard on the wind and felt in the earth. \n\nThe days of the King have come at last, and may they be blessed."
 gondor.0502.a:0 "I will protect my people."
 
 gondor.0503.t:0 "The Defiance of the Steward"
 gondor.0503.desc:0 "The steward flatly refuses to acknowledge the claim of Aragorn. The line of Isildur, if it be not broken, is long bereft of lordship, and unfit to rule so mighty a people. \n\nHowever, it would appear the people do not agree. News of the events at the citadel have leaked from displeased guardsmen, and soon the city is in a furore over this betrayal by the Ruling Stewards. Soon, the Lords of Gondor have heard of this, and they also are wroth at this perceived dereliction of their oaths and duties. \n\nThe garrison of Minas Tirith has openly revolted and imprisoned the Steward in the White Tower. The lords of Gondor have ridden with all haste to Minas Tirith, and there sworn their loyalty to the King. \n\nThe days of the Stewards have ended, not in dignity, but in disgrace."
 gondor.0503.a:0 "So passes the rule of Húrin's line."

 
 gondor.0504.t:0 "Elessar or Aragorn?"
 gondor.0504.desc:0 "In the days of old, it was the way of the Númenórean kings to take their names in Quenya. Though this practice has long since passed, I could revive it. The people have taken to calling me the Elfstone - perhaps that would be a fitting name for a king? There are event a scant few that are pushing me towards taking up a name in Adunaic."
 gondor.0504.a:0 "Tar-Elessar it shall be, a scion of Elros."
 gondor.0504.b:0 "Aragorn I have been, and Aragorn will I remain."
 gondor.0504.c:0 "Ar-Nimruzimir it shall be, for the sons of Númenor"
 
 gondor.0505.t:0 "A New House for a New Age?"
 gondor.0505.desc:0 "The line of Isildur, and of Elendil his father, at last sits once more in Minas Tirith. But a new age is dawning on us, a new Gondor. Shall I add another branch to the great tree of Elros, and begin a new royal house?"
 gondor.0505.a:0 "The house of Telcontar it shall be."
 gondor.0505.b:0 "The house of Isildurionath we will remain."
 
 gondor.0506.t:0 "A Dream from Long Ago..."
 gondor.0506.desc:0 "I first met Arwen Undómiel when I was 20 in the gardens of Rivendell, and then I named her Lúthien, for she was surely the most beautiful of all the living. On Cerin Amroth in Lórien did we swear to be bound, even under the shadow of the east and the twilight of the west. Through many trials now have I come, and the time has come to fulfill our promises to each other."
 gondor.0506.a:0 "A dream from long ago, finally realized..."
 gondor.0506.a.tt:0 "Marry Arwen Undómiel."
 gondor.0506.b:0 "I dream of a Shieldmaiden of Rohan..."
 gondor.0506.b.tt:0 "Marry Éowyn of the Riddermark."
 gondor.0506.c:0 "A maiden of Númenor's high kindred occupies my dreams..."
 gondor.0506.c.tt:0 "Marry Lothíriel of Dol Amroth."
 gondor.0506.d:0 "I cannot sunder Arwen from her people..."
 gondor.0506.d.tt:0 "Marry no-one, for now."
 
 gondor.0507.t:0 " The Glory of Gondor Restored"
 gondor.0507.desc:0 "The King has at last returned to Gondor, and her people now rejoice. But a fell wind is upon the east, and the malice that was slowly building has now turned to fiery hate at the return of his oldest foe. Time shall tell if the King's return signals a new beginning... or an end."
 gondor.0507.a:0 "To whatever end..."

 gondor.0508.t:0 "The Queen is with Child"
 gondor.0508.desc:0 "At last, the long sundered lines of the halfelven are once more united, and that union is now made manifest, for Arwen is with child. It is a joyous occasion, and all of Minas Tirith rejoices with its King as they await the arrival of the heir to the throne."
 gondor.0508.a:0 "I dream of a boy."
 
 gondor.0509.t:0 "Heir of the Kings of Men"
 gondor.0509.desc:0 "The child comes quickly and fairly painlessly, and he is strong and healthy. From a mere glance, it is apparent that he takes after both of his parents, and that he shall be wise, strong, and beautiful in his manhood. What shall be his name, this last-scion of the fading elves, heir to the Kings of Men?"
 gondor.0509.a:0 "His name will be Eldarion."
 
 gondor.0510.t:0 "The Second Child"
 gondor.0510.desc:0 "Again, Queen Arwen has become pregnant, and all the kingdom is ripe with anticipation, with many guessing whether Prince Eldarion shall receive a brother or sister."
 gondor.0510.a:0 "A boy or a girl?"
 
 gondor.0511.t:0 "The Third Coming of Tinúviel?"
 gondor.0511.desc:0 "After a tiring birth, the King is passed his second child, his first daughter. She takes after her mother closely, and all can see she will be an incomparable beauty in the flowering of her youth. What shall she be named, this rival to the Evenstar, the beauty of the ancient days made manifest once more?"
 gondor.0511.a:0 "Her name will be Lúthien."
 
 gondor.0512.t:0 "A Third Pregnancy"
 gondor.0512.desc:0 "Once more the Queen is pregnant, and now some of the court joke that the King and Queen are aiming to at least do Master Elrond one better, and aiming to outdo Fëanor himself if they may."
 gondor.0512.a:0 "We are truly blessed."
 
 gondor.0513.t:0 "A Memory of the Vanyar"
 gondor.0513.desc:0 "Like her sister, the new child is beautiful, but it is a different beauty than her mother and sister. Her eyes seem to burn with an ancient light, and the King is struck with the memory of the Lady Galadriel when gazing upon her. What name shall she bear, this daughter of Finarfin's line?"
 gondor.0513.a:0 "Her name will be Indis."
 
 gondor.0514.t:0 "The Final Pregnancy"
 gondor.0514.desc:0 "Once more the Queen is pregnant, but the King and Queen seem to think this may be the last. They will not say why to those that ask them, but they seem assured in this fact, and so the court busies itself preparing for another royal birth - perhaps the last of this generation."
 gondor.0514.a:0 "No more children? Why not?"
 
 gondor.0515.t:0 "The Last Child of Aragorn and Arwen"
 gondor.0515.desc:0 "In appearance, the new princess is as her sister, bearing calm serenity and piercing bright eyes that drink in everything around her. Queen Arwen quips that she's reminded of her grandmother's unnerving gaze, and after faltering a moment, the King recovers and agrees with a laugh. It seems even just the memory of the anger of the Lady Galadriel is enough to make such a mighty King stumble. What name shall she bear, this final child of the King and Queen?"
 gondor.0515.a:0 "Her name will be Altáriel."
 
 gondor.0516.t:0 "A Fateful Choice"
 gondor.0516.desc:0 "At long last the line of Isildur has returned. And although I may have been lowered from my prior position as Lord Steward of the realm, I am gladdened by the prosperity of our people and the land. It is a new age, and now I must decide which course I shall take..."
 gondor.0516.a:0 "I will remain as [ROOT.Char.GetName], Steward of Gondor."
 gondor.0516.b:0 "Our purpose is fulfilled."
 gondor.0516.b.tt:0 "You will play as Aragorn, High King of Gondor."
 
 gondor.0517.t:0 "The Return of the King"
 gondor.0517.desc:0 "In a grand ceremony in Minas Tirith, Aragorn II, heir of Isildur and chieftain of the Dúnedain of Arnor has been proclaimed King of Gondor, High-King of the Dúnedain-in-exile, Lord of the West. He has proven his identity beyond all doubt, bearing Andúril, Narsil reforged, and his claim has been accepted by the lords and people of Gondor. \n\nIn his youth he was Thorongil, the Eagle of the Star, and in Gondor and Rohan alike that name served with valour and distinction. The people of Gondor have not forgotten their great Captain, now returned at an hour unexpected, and their joy is bright as the sun in summer. \n\nIt is a happening unlooked for by the peoples of the south, the line of Isildur long ago deemed dead and gone. Yet already a change in the winds can be felt, a people's will ringing upon the waves and silver trumpets proclaiming their defiance. Gondor, long lethargic, stirs from its stupor and seems to be regaining its long-fading strength. \n\nGondor's allies rejoice, while those that are set against the Dúnedain have been seized with a great terror and despair, foreseeing in the return of the King their doom."
 gondor.0517.a:0 "Renewed shall be blade that was broken, the crownless again shall be king."
 gondor.0517.b:0 "Accursed Dúnedain! Your end shall come soon, King or no."
 
 gondor.1000.t:0 "The Reclamation of Harondor"
 gondor.1000.desc:0 "For many years, Harondor has slowly slipped away from the control of Gondor, the Haradrim gaining evermore power therein and pushing the Dúnedain from their lands. Now at last the tide has been reversed, and the province fully reclaimed. \n\nLet it be said Harondor is a contested land no longer - Gondor has reclaimed her own!"
 gondor.1000.a:0 "A great day for all Dúnedain."
 
 gondor.1001.t:0 "Gondor proclaims the Province of Harondor"
 gondor.1001.desc:0 "In a grand proclamation, the royal authorities in Gondor have proclaimed that the Province of Harondor has been fully reclaimed at long last. They promise that they shall exert every effort to restore the province's eroded infrastructure and to rebuild the economy of the war-torn province. Many have begun to question if this is the herald of a larger Gondorian reconquest of other lost territories. \n\nWhatever else, nobody can now deny that Gondor has a firm grip over Harondor now."
 gondor.1001.a:0 "Congratulations are in order for Minas Tirith."
 gondor.1001.b:0 "Damn them! They have no right to that land, colonizers and usurpers!"
