 ### DENETHOR EVENTS ###
 gondor.0100.t:0 "The Steward of Gondor"
 gondor.0100.desc:0 "For twenty-five generations the Stewards of Gondor have kept a vigilant watch over the lands of Gondor, serving as its keepers and highest authority until the return of a rightful claimant to its kingship. Hardships—innumerable and often terrible, have come to pass during these times. There is no peace, for the men of Gondor can afford no such relief. Men are raised into soldiers instead of scholars; and iron is wrought into devices meant for war and nothing else.\n\nThe kingdom’s strength in waning. To the East a Great Shadow stirs. A nameless fear besieges the eastern shore. Patrols vanish without a word, and tradesmen are harried along the coasts. The decisive hour approaches, and for the kingdom of Gondor to endure it will need the likes Cirion or Ecthelion to lead its peoples.\n\nAlas, then, that these dark days should fall upon the vindictive Steward Denethor. He is a man loved by few and distrusted by many. And although the early days of his rule boded well for the kingdom’s future, the sudden death of his wife Finduilas wracked him greatly. Grief-stricken, he is silent whenever command is needed; and he is grim whenever hope seems within grasp…\n\nUncertain, is the future of Gondor. It stands on a razor’s edge, and a single breeze could cast it down into the depths of darkness. But likewise, it could perhaps be restored to its former greatness just as quickly. Whatever might occur, in this moment the looming shadow moves ever-westward, encompassing all with its darkness and destruction..."

 gondor.0100.a.tt:0 "We must prepare. He comes."
 
 ### BOROMIR EVENTS ###
 gondor.0200.t:0 "The Captain of Gondor"
 gondor.0200.desc:0 "For many years it has been a tradition for the heir to Gondor - either of the Kings or the Stewards - to serve as the Captain of the White Tower, leader of the Citadel Guard, bearer of the Horn of Gondor. No man was ever born more suited to the role than Boromir, elder son of the Steward Denethor. Loved and respected by his people and his men, Boromir is a man of the make of King Eärnur. Bearing great strength and valour, he is an honorable man, with a burning desire to see his people safe from the encroaching shadow. He is not a man much concerned with the old lore and wisdoms, save in the tales of old battles, and his zeal for his country may be yet his salvation or his damnation. \n\nTo the Captain of the White Tower Gondor looks, and upon him is its hope laid and remain, lest some hope unlooked for comes to rally the people once more."
 gondor.0200.a:0 "And the tower guard shall take up the call: The Lords of Gondor have returned."

 ### FARAMIR EVENTS ###
 gondor.0300.t:0 "The Rangers of Ithilien"
 gondor.0300.desc:0 "The younger son of the Steward Denethor is a man in the mold of Numenor of old; kind, compassionate, learned and wise, yet not without skill in arms. Faramir would rather he never had to bear a sword, preferring the tales of yore and the library to any warsong and battlefield. Yet in this dwindling days, all sons of Gondor must fight for her safety, and Faramir has taken up his burden gladly to defend the last cities of the sons of Numenor. While Boromir leads the men of Gondor openly as Captain of the White Tower, Faramir's task is more subtle, but just as important. As their Captain, he leads the Ithilien Rangers, the forward-guard of Gondor. From the trees do his mens strike, harassing and hampering the forces of the Enemy. Many a force has been ended before Boromir's brave forces could ever face them by Faramir's solemn watch. \n\nBut a day will soon come when Faramir may be asked to burden an inheritance he never dreamed or feared would be his."
 gondor.0300.a:0 "I do not love the bright sword for its sharpness, nor the arrow for its swiftness, nor the warrior for his glory. I love only that which they defend."

 ### DOL AMROTH EVENTS ###
 gondor.0400.t:0 "The Princedom of Dol Amroth"
 gondor.0400.desc:0 "Since the days of Numenor of old, the line of Imrazôr has flew their banner from the spires of proud Dol Amroth. It is said that Imrazôr took to wed one of the Elves, and that the eldar-blood runs still in the veins of the Princes. The Princes of Dol Amroth are second in dignity and honor in Gondor only to the Kings and the Stewards, and their princedom is the oldest and most powerful of the provinces of Gondor. The Knights of the Silver Swan are the mightiest cavalry in the world of Men, save perhaps Rohan alone, and the thunder of the hooves of Dol Amroth have set many a foe to flight. \n\nIn these days of dwindling might and growing dread, Gondor leans ever-more on her mightiest princes. The line of Imrazôr shall not fail their duty."
 gondor.0400.a:0 "Forth, Knights of the Silver Swan!"
