 colonisation_random.0001.t:0 "The Squirrel"
 colonisation_random.0001.desc:0 "While journeying to visit my colony of [colony_province.GetName], my company and I pause for a light repast among the trees. I find myself lost in thought, mulling over the most recent challenges faced by my realm. Suddenly my reverie is broken by a rustling in the boughs above. In the gloom it takes a moment before I can identify the source of the sound - a sleek black squirrel.\n\nIt stares at me. I stare back. Something in its beady gaze strikes me as malevolent. I realise that my men are watching this stand-off with interest, and so decide to take the opportunity to demonstrate my prowess. Slowly, I reach out and grasp a pine cone that lies near my feet. With a flash I throw it at the squirrel. Then, to my horror, the squirrel easily dodges the cone and launches itself shrieking at my face!"

 colonisation_random.0002.t:0 "The White Hart"
 colonisation_random.0002.desc:0 "I scout the tangled woodland paths near my colony of [colony_province.GetName], marvelling at the sheer density of the ancient forest. In places trees grow almost trunk-to-trunk. Fallen deadwood sprouts luminous mushrooms. Living trees are strewn with vine and creepers, and shrouded in spongy mosses and trailing lichens. The air is pungent with a thousand scents of vibrant life and foetid decay.\n\nSuddenly I see it. Caught in a shaft of light breaking through the canopy like a heavenly spear: a huge deer, ice-white, with amber eyes which fix on me for a moment.\n\nThen, with a snorting exhalation, the white hart springs away down the path. You hear the sound of your company drawing their bows behind you."

 colonisation_random.1001.t:0 "The Burial"
 colonisation_random.1001.desc:0 "My attempt to settle a colony in the deep forests around [colony_province.GetName] is bold, some would say foolhardy. Yet the Old Dwarf Road, or ‘Viduweg’ in our tongue, is one of the few paths across Mirkwood, and any realm capable of reopening it and restoring contact with the realms on the far side will gain great strategic advantage… and not a little coin from the tolls.\n\nI have arrived to inspect my work-gangs felling trees encroaching on the old road, uprooting stumps and filling holes so that a cart might pass. Suddenly a cry goes up! Under the tangled roots of a toppled tree a flat stone has been found, on which is carved the faded remnant of a dwarven rune. Is this the burial site of some dwarven traveller from ages past?"

 colonisation_random.1002.desc:0 "[martial_companion.GetName] has been expressing [martial_companion.GetHerHis] concerns about the goblin nests threatening our colony in [colony_province.GetName].\n\n“The orcish filth continue to raid and despoil. They have killed many settlers, and are deterring more from coming. The colony will soon fail without a show of force to drive them back into their squalid caves…”\n\nI know [martial_companion.GetSheHe] speaks the truth. Troops must be marshalled to drive the goblins away from my settlement, and garrison it to reassure the colonists. However, I fear this won’t be cheap…"

 colonisation_random.2001.t:0 "Recruitment Drive"
 colonisation_random.2001.desc:0 "In many ways I am pleased with the progress of the colony in [colony_province.GetName]. An advance party has identified a new site for settlement, and a simple hall and a number of shelters and storage buildings have already been raised. Tools and foodstuffs have been stockpiled to get the settlement through its early years, and land is being cleared for grazing and planting.\n\nHowever, an exasperated [stewardship_companion.GetName] complains that too few people seem willing to emigrate to the settlement. If the colony is to survive and thrive then more settlers will need to be encouraged to make the move."
