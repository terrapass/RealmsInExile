 colonisation_random.0001.t:0 "The Squirrel"
 colonisation_random.0001.desc:0 "While journeying to visit my colony of [colony_province.GetName], my company and I pause for a light repast among the trees. I find myself lost in thought, mulling over the most recent challenges faced by my realm. Suddenly my reverie is broken by a rustling in the boughs above. In the gloom it takes a moment before I can identify the source of the sound - a sleek black squirrel.\n\nIt stares at me. I stare back. Something in its beady gaze strikes me as malevolent. I realise that my men are watching this stand-off with interest, and so decide to take the opportunity to demonstrate my prowess. Slowly, I reach out and grasp a pine cone that lies near my feet. With a flash I throw it at the squirrel. Then, to my horror, the squirrel easily dodges the cone and launches itself shrieking at my face!"

 colonisation_random.0002.t:0 "The White Hart"
 colonisation_random.0002.desc:0 "I scout the tangled woodland paths near my colony of [colony_province.GetName], marvelling at the sheer density of the ancient forest. In places trees grow almost trunk-to-trunk. Fallen deadwood sprouts luminous mushrooms. Living trees are strewn with vine and creepers, and shrouded in spongy mosses and trailing lichens. The air is pungent with a thousand scents of vibrant life and foetid decay.\n\nSuddenly I see it. Caught in a shaft of light breaking through the canopy like a heavenly spear: a huge deer, ice-white, with amber eyes which fix on me for a moment.\n\nThen, with a snorting exhalation, the white hart springs away down the path. I can hear the sound of my company drawing their bows behind me."

 colonisation_random.0003.desc:0 "I have finally found the time to inspect my colony in [colony_province.GetName]. The journey has been long and wearying, but my spirits are instantly lifted on arrival at the settlement. I can almost smell the frontier spirit.\n\nThe colony is a hive of activity, and the sounds of axes striking wood and hammers crashing against anvils echo through the hills, as do the ringing voices of the settlers, who often burst spontaneously into song while they labour. These are a hale and hearty people, and I feel honoured to be their liege.\n\nThe rocky uplands are unsuited for planting, and my colonists report the urgent need for tough sheep and goat breeds to provide both sustenance and pelts for clothing. The colony is rich in metals and stone for trade, but a deal needs to be struck with the guilds to transport the colony’s exports to the realm’s markets so that they can be exchanged for livestock."

The strategic value of the area is clear, as a strong colony here would help protect the Anduin River trading routes and keep watch over the southern fringes of Mirkwood.\n\nWith great labour, rich silt has been dredged from the Anduin, and many a cartload transported to my colony and ploughed into the necrotic soil. At last there are signs of life, and green grasses have begun to spring up where once there was only barren earth.\n\nYet progress is slow, and it is evident that the colony will need to be supplied with food and fodder for many years to come, at great expense.
