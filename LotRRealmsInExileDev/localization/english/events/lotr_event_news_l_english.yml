 news_event.0001.desc:0 "The Tedjin Confederacy is roiling with unrest, as the ambitious new Kataj Bór seeks to push forward political and religious reforms. In response, the more conservative lords of the confederacy have begun to covertly resist Bór's efforts at every turn.\n\nWhile we might quickly dismiss the internal squabbles of desert tribesmen, the Tedjin are renowned fighters and mercenaries, and occupy a vital buffer between Umbar and Bellakar. Should the reactionary lords succeed in overthrowing Bór, their ambitions will surely turn South once more.\n\nFinally, the crisis in the Confederacy has finally reached breaking point. Formal demands for the Reformist Kataj to abdicate sent by the Reactionary Faction have been outright rejected and the two sides are now in open war.\n\nTime is fast running out for interested parties to make their interventions as the future of the Confederacy hangs in the balance."
