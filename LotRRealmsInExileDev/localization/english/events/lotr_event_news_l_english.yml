 news_event.0001.t:0 "The Tedjin Civil War"
 news_event.0001.desc:0 "[GetTitleByKey('k_tedjin').GetName] is roiling with unrest, as the ambitious new [defender.GetTitledFirstName] seeks to push forward political and religious reforms. In response, the more conservative lords of the confederacy, led by [attacker.GetTitledFirstName] have begun to covertly resist [defender.GetFirstNameNoTooltip]'s efforts at every turn.\n\nWhile we might quickly dismiss the internal squabbles of desert tribesmen, the Tedjin are renowned fighters and mercenaries, and occupy a vital buffer between Umbar and Bellakar. Should [attacker.GetFirstNameNoTooltip] and [attacker.GetHerHis] fellow reactionary lords succeed in overthrowing [defender.GetFirstNameNoTooltip], their ambitions will surely turn South once more.\n\nFinally, the crisis in the Confederacy has reached breaking point. Formal demands for the Reformist Kataj to abdicate sent by the Reactionary Faction have been outright rejected and the two sides are now in open war.\n\nTime is fast running out for interested parties to make their interventions as the future of the Confederacy hangs in the balance."

 news_event.0002.desc:0 "The [tedjinfounder.GetCulture.GetName] forces under [tedjinfounder.GetTitledFirstName] have seized large parts of the western coastline in a realm stretching from the Harnen to the Bay of Felaya.\n\nThese zealous new converts to the faith of [erutheone|E] have taken it upon themselves to forge a new home for themselves in the ancient cities of the Corsairs of [GetTitleByKey('k_mardruak').GetBaseNameNoTier] and [GetTitleByKey('k_umbar').GetBaseNameNoTier].\n\nAnd still, their leaders have not forgotten the meddling of [GetTitleByKey('k_haruzan').GetBaseNameNoTier] in their affairs, and have long nursed a grudge. Perhaps from their new base of power they might attempt to even assault [GetTitleByKey('c_amrun').GetBaseNameNoTier] itself."
 news_event.0002.a:0 "A triumph for the righteous!"
 news_event.0002.b:0 "Are they friend or foe?"

 news_event.0003.desc:0 "In a decisive campaign, [tedjinfounder.GetTitledFirstName] has seized much of the Harnen, drawing close to both [GetTitleByKey('e_gondor').GetBaseNameNoTier] and [GetTitleByKey('e_mordor').GetBaseNameNoTier].\n\nIn such a prime position they now have a strong hold on the north-south trade over both land and sea, and are sure to prosper from it.\n\nTime will tell if they shall continue their meteoric rise, or fall from having flown too close to [ariencharacter|E]."

 news_event.0004.desc:0 "In a shocking turn, the fearsome [tedjinfounder.GetCulture.GetName] Empire of [GetTitleByKey('e_tedjin').GetBaseNameNoTier] has been resurrected by [tedjinfounder.GetName].\n\nQadjajar once controlled all of [GetTitleByKey('e_bellakar').GetBaseNameNoTier], but its heartland was always in the northern provinces of Bellakar, [GetTitleByKey('k_mardruak').GetBaseNameNoTier] and [GetTitleByKey('k_felaya').GetBaseNameNoTier], and this was what the Tedjin referred to when using the name.\n\nNow, with a brutal conquest of Mardrûak and Felaya, the Tedjin have finally rebuilt the state that so long ago crumbled and the ancient palaces of [GetTitleByKey('c_joam').GetBaseNameNoTier] have been proclaimed as the capital of this restored state.\n\nWill the ambitious [tedjinfounder.GetTitledFirstName] next attempt to restore the maximum extent of Qadjajar, and also conquer southern Bellakar?"

 news_event.0006.desc:0 "The civil war in [GetTitleByKey('k_tedjin').GetName], fought between reformist and reactionary factions within the realm and fueled by the support of major powers in the region, has finally come to an end.\n\nDespite lacking in number compared with [defender.GetHerHis] rebellious subjects [defender.GetTitledFirstName] has prevailed decisively. The rebellious lords under the leadership of the reactionary [attacker.GetTitledFirstName] have been humbled, sure to be either stripped of their lands, exiled, or executed.\n\nThe old ways are fast fading in the lands of the Tedjin, and as [defender.GetTitledFirstNameNoTooltip] intensifies [defender.GetHerHis] reforms, [defender.GetHerHis] gaze turns westward towards the coast and may even come to challenge the hegemony of the [GetTitleByKey('k_umbar').GetName] itself..."
 news_event.0006.a:0 "Proof that a righteous cause will always prevail!"

 news_event.0008.t:0 "Rapprochement between Bellakar and Felaya"
 news_event.0008.desc:0 "While technically never independent from the [GetTitleByKey('e_bellakar').GetBaseName], in practical terms the region of [GetTitleByKey('k_felaya').GetBaseNameNoTier] has acted wholly autonomously since the reign of [amrozir.GetFirstNameRegnal] almost 1000 years ago.\n\nPeriods of rapprochement and estrangement have waxed and waned between the province and the greater kingdom, as religiously it stood distinct from the southern heartlands of the kingdom, and its culture nurtured a burgeoning pride in their self-reliance. The First Lords have even warred with Bellakar in the past when they overstepped their bounds.\n\nNow at last relations appear to be on the permanent mend, as the First Lord of Felaya has officially traveled to [GetTitleByKey('c_nilulonde').GetBaseNameNoTier] to pay homage and swear fealty to their new overlord, something which has not been done since the days of [masrakayan.GetTitledFirstName] and [zimrubel.GetTitledFirstName].\n\nThis rapprochement appears to be largely due to [bellakarruler.GetTitledFirstName|U], whose careful diplomacy, overtures, and assurances to the people of Felaya as to their status within the greater kingdom has allowed the rift to be mended without a painful and bloody reconquest."

 news_event.0009.desc:0 "Unlooked for, unasked for, and shocking the entirety of the [bayoftulwang|E], the Honnin tribesman dwelling in the Sûza Sûmar have marched throughout the Rây, claiming cities and settling their people in small bands throughout the land.\n\nThe Honnin were the first men to dwell in the Rây, and built the first monolithic stone structures within the region. It was they who first taught the Apysaic Haradrim how to work stone and cultivate agriculture. However, as the Haradrim migrated into the fertile and lush valleys, a coexistence of teacher and student turned into a silent tug of war. The Honnin, unlovely to behold and slow to reproduce, were forced out by the ever multiplying Bôzishnarûd into the Sûza Sûmar, whence they lost much of their knowledge and teachings.\n\nNow though, this has changed. The Honnin, under the lead of [grab Honnin leader] have reclaimed their ancestral homeland, what they name the Sûzush Agkhôr. Already they are raising new great stone structures, and seem set with a grave determination to never again suffer the ruin they have now begun to recover from."

From deep within the forest of Fangorn the ancient Onodrim, known to Men as the [ents|E], have marched to war against Isengard, seeking vengeance against the power-hungry [saruman.GetFirstName].\n\nIn a brutally decisive battle, the Ring of [isengard|E] has been torn down, and its pits have been flooded by the River Isen, sending a deluge down the valley when the Ents broke the great damn Saruman had built there. Saruman is now a prisoner within his own tower and the Ents having hunted down every last of his Uruk-hai in the region, extinguishing the last of his power.\n\nThe Children of Yavanna have dealt a decisive blow against the darkness this day."
