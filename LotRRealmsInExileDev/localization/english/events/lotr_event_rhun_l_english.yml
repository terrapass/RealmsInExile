 rhun.0010.t:0 "The Logath"
 rhun.0010.desc:0 "Since the Battle at Dagorlad, where our great Easterling hosts were felled by the Last Alliance, our people have wandered as one lost. Withdrawing from the barren lands of our ancient mothers, we rode north to the forests beneath the Iron Hills there to find a new home for our families, one far away from the Dark Lands.\n\nWhen first they spied us, the neighbouring Dorwinrim cried out, “Balcoth! Balcoth!”, loud noises were made, and a time of suffering was had. They granted the wild, wooded vales above their lands and kept watch at the fords of the Carnen. In the Iron Hills are dwarves, making hard negotiations with our river tribes for passage through to the markets of Dorwinion and Dale."

Listening to the whispers of merchants, concerning the safety of home, of returning to their wives: there is trouble abroad.\n\nOur new home is fair and green, where a woman can feel the free air and wander with her herds. Yet always we feel lost in this Middle-earth, perhaps it is time to return to the shores of the Sea of Rhûn."
