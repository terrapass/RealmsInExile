 abdark.0001.desc:0 "The Cult of Khäz-gramaze has been in a troubled state as of late. Since the fall of Barad-Dur, the Cult's popularity has been steadily declining and many of my people have started to return to the old ways of worship.\nVoices have been growing louder in my court, voices claiming that this is a good development and that we should cast down our remaining shrines to the Serpent-King and promote the worship of Nâdi-manyê.\n\nI cannot pretend that I have not had doubts myself as of late. No matter my decision, I should take a clear stance regarding our peoples' path."
 abdark.0001.a:0 "We have served Khäz-gramaze for long enough."
 abdark.0001.at:0 "You place an idol of Nâdi-manyê on your personal altar."
 abdark.0001.b:0 "Nonsense, we cannot abandon the Long Vengeance!"
 abdark.0001.bt:0 "You demand all your courtiers stay strong in their devotion to Khäz-gramaze."
 abdark.0001.btt:0 "Some of your realm counties may convert anyways."
