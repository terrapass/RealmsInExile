 umbar.0100.t:0 "The Exiles of Ar-Adûnâim"
 umbar.0100.desc:0 "On a lonely archipelago in the sea of Belegaer is the self-proclaimed Ar-Adûnâim. Those who visit it may find two different experiences. Those who bear the blood of Numenor find a welcoming group which carries itself with dignity and honor. Those that do not, however, find themselves abused and spat upon, detested and treated like nothing more than feral dogs. Such is the nature of this exiled group of blood purists, cast out from the Haven of Umbar for their radical views. \n\nArising shortly after the arrival of Castimir the Usurper in Umbar, for years the blood-purists were merely another faction within Umbar - in fact, there is still a strong one in Umbar even after their departure. But the Ar-Adûnâim began to agitate for a great 'cleansing' of the Havens, which would bring about a restoration of Numenorean purity and be the herald of a glorious reclamation of their long-lost empire. Pragmatists in Umbar ultimately were forced to act when a rally transformed into a lynch mob that resulted in a fire which devastated a large section of the port. \n\nSince then, the Ar-Adûnâim have stewed on their rocks in the sea, awaiting the beginning of their great crusade. Their leader, Gimilkhâd, claims to have spoken with his august ancestor Ar-Pharazôn through the mediation of the Great Lord, Mulkhêr. If they keep the faith, and offer sacrifices in his name, then the Great Lord shall bring forth the Great Armament, and the armies of Anadûnê shall once more roll over the land."
