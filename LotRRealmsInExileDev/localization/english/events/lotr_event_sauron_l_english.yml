 sauron.0510.desc:0 "At long last, Sauron's hour is coming. He has had setbacks - the defiance of Celebrimbor and the Elves, the intervention of the Númenóreans not once but thrice - once in the War of Sauron and the Elves, another by Ar-Pharazôn, and lastly by accursed Elendil and his sons. \n\nThe defeat at the 'Last Alliance' was a great blow, but even in their triumph Sauron's enemies failed at the last, for the One endured, and so was his return made inevitable. His great servant, Angmar, destroyed the North-Kingdom of Arnor, extinguishing the accursed line of Isildur. In the south, Gondor teeters, ready to fall. The Elves have not the might now to throw him back through strength of arms, nor the Dwarves, though both will long hold their own lands. \n\nAll the East has been marshalled beneath the malice of the Dark Tower, and there is no hope for the West."
