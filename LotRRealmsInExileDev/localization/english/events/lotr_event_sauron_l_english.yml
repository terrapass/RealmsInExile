 sauron.0510.t:0 "The Lord of the Rings"
 sauron.0510.desc:0 "At long last, Sauron's hour is coming. He has had setbacks - the defiance of Celebrimbor and the Elves, the intervention of the Númenóreans not once but thrice - once in the War of Sauron and the Elves, another by Ar-Pharazôn, and lastly by accursed Elendil and his sons. \n\nThe defeat at the 'Last Alliance' was a great blow, but even in their triumph Sauron's enemies failed at the last, for the One endured, and so was his return made inevitable. His great servant, Angmar, destroyed the North-Kingdom of Arnor, extinguishing the accursed line of Isildur. In the south, Gondor teeters, ready to fall. The Elves have not the might now to throw him back through strength of arms, nor the Dwarves. Soon, the One Ring will reveal itself again, and then there will be nothing that can stand against Sauron. \n\nMiddle-Earth has been abandoned by the Valar and is ready for a new master to put it in order. All the East has been marshalled beneath the malice of the Dark Tower, and there is no hope for the fading West."
 sauron.0510.a:0 "Lord of the Rings, Lord of the Earth!"
 sauron.0510.a.tt:0 "At long last, Middle-Earth shall be brought to Order. Sauron's order."

sauron.0511.t:0 "The Hammer of the Underworld"
sauron.0511.desc:0 "“Great engines crawled across the field; and in the midst was a huge ram, great as a forest-tree a hundred feet in length, swinging on mighty chains. Long had it been forging in the dark smithies of Mordor, and its hideous head, founded of black steel, was shaped in the likeness of a ravening wolf; on it spells of ruin lay. Grond they named it, in memory of the Hammer of the Underworld of old. Great beasts drew it, orcs surrounded it, and behind walked mountain-trolls to wield it.” \n\nGrond, Hammer of the Underworld, breaker of cities, at last is ready to be unleashed upon your foes."
sauron.0511.a:0 "Grond! Grond! Grond! Grond!"
