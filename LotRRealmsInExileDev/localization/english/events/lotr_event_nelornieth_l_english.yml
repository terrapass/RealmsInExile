 nelornieth.0001.desc.intro:0 "My chancellor approaches, parchment in hand.\n\n"Sire, at your request I have compiled a list of the Elven realms enduring in [middleearth|E]. They are as follow:"
 nelornieth.0001.desc.lasgalen:0 "\n\nThe kingdom of [erynlasgalen|E] occupies the north of the largest forest in Middle-Earth. Its subjects are numerous but reclusive. Their seasoned troops would make them precious allies."
 nelornieth.0001.desc.lorien:0 "\n\nThe realm of [lothlorien|E] of the golden mellyrn is cradled between the roots of the [mistymountains|E]. Though small in size, it is protected by the power of [lorienking.GetTitledFirstNameNoTooltip] and remains unsullied. Even a small portion of that power would be of great use."
 nelornieth.0001.desc.random:0 "\n\nThe [GetTitleByKey('scope:extrakingdom').GetName] was until recently unknown to us. The distant [extraking.GetFirstNameRegnalNoTooltip] will most likely greet our ambassadors with pleasure."

 nelornieth.0010.desc:0 "The Avari ambassador has formally invited me to their embassy for a traditional Avari banquet. As soon as I enter the hall my senses are filled with a whirlwind of sensations, smells and music alien and yet strangely familiar to me.\n\nI am seated at the place of honour and presented with the strangest dishes, combinations of meats and herbs that none of my subjects had ever dreamed of. Once the food is eaten and the wine drunk, the dancing starts, to the tune of harps and flutes."
 nelornieth.0010.a:0 "Such incredible tastes! And such intricate dancing!"
 nelornieth.0010.b:0 "This isn't as fascinating as they made it out to be"

 nelornieth.0011.b:0 "[ambassador.GetFirstNameNoTooltip], what have you done?"
 nelornieth.0011.c:0 "Well, at least you managed not to offend [embassy_target.GetHerHim]"

 nelornieth.0020.desc:0 "The Avari ambassador has formally invited me to their embassy for a hunt after the Avari way.\n\nWe first dressed in woodland colours and painted our faces with dark colours and strange symbols. Then we spread out noiselessly into the woods.\n\nAfter some time without any sighting I hear the cry of an unfamiliar bird to my left and realise it is the signal from one of the hunters. He points to my right, where a magnificent ten-pronged hart is grazing, totally unaware of our presence.\n\nWe approach in silence and against the wind and, upon [ambassador.GetFirstNameNoTooltip]'s signal, I shoot an arrow throw its heart, granting it a swift painless death."
 nelornieth.0020.a:0 "This way of hunting is thrilling!"
 nelornieth.0020.b:0 "I'll admit it's different, but not very exciting"

 nelornieth.0021.desc.intro:0 "My liege, we have organised a great hunt for [embassy_target.GetTitledFirstNameNoTooltip]'s enjoyment.\n\nOur hunters had located a great ten-pronged hart, and, silent as a whisper, we brought [embassy_target.GetHerHim] so close to the quarry [embassy_target.GetSheHe] could nearly touch it, before firing the killing arrow at point-blank."
 nelornieth.0021.desc.success:0 "\n\n[embassy_target.GetTitledFirstNameNoTooltip] seems to have greatly enjoyed [embassy_target.GetHerHim]self, [embassy_target.GetSheHe] kept repeating how thrilling it had been."
 nelornieth.0021.desc.failure:0 "\n\n[embassy_target.GetTitledFirstNameNoTooltip] clearly derived no pleasure from our hunt, and spent the whole trip back complaining at the absence of horses and hounds."

 nelornieth.0030.desc:0 "The Avari ambassador has formally invited me to their embassy for a meditation after the Avari way.\n\nWe walked through the woods for a while before reaching a secluded spot: a clearing near a forest rivulet.\n\n[ambassador.GetFirstNameNoTooltip] sat without a word next to the river and invited me to do the same with a nod.\n\nAs we started to meditate the rest of the Avari delegation retreated behind the treeline and started to murmur a chant in their language. I could hear in their song the sound of the wind, the cry of strange birds and the waves of distant seas."
 nelornieth.0030.a:0 "The experience was entrancing"
 nelornieth.0030.b:0 "I don't see what this chanting brings to the table"

I sing my best, followed by the Avari ambassador, before our best poets exchange songs, one after the other."
 nelornieth.0040.a:0 "There is so much about them we didn't suspect!"
