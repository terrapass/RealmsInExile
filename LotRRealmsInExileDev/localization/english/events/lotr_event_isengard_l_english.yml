 isengard.0101.t:0 "The Lord of Isengard"
 isengard.0101.desc:0 "The great Iron Fortress of [isengard|E] has long guarded the southern flank of the [mistymountains|E], the great spire of [orthanc|E] rising from its heart keeping watch over the surrounding valley and the Fords of Isen beyond.\n\nThis great tower was fashioned by builders of the lost realm of [numenor|E], yet it seems not to be made of the craft of Men, but riven from the bones of the earth in the ancient torment of the hills.\n\nIt was at the crowning of [frealaf.GetName] that I appeared, following the death of [helm.GetFirstNameNicknamed] and his sons at the hands of [wulf.GetFirstName] and his Dunlendings. I brought gifts, and sang great praise of the valour of the [rohirrim|E], quickly earning the love of new King.\n\nSeeking greater security against Dunlending raids, the King convinced [beren.GetName] to grant me the keys to the abandoned tower of Orthanc, to act as a Warden over the western borderlands and a representative of the Steward."
 isengard.0101.a:0 "And so have I remained for the last 240 years..."

 isengard.0102.t:0 "My Search for the One"
 isengard.0102.desc:0 "Since taking residence in [isengard|E], I have uncovered many of its secrets, the greatest prize of all being the Orthanc-stone, one of the seven [palantir|E] of [numenor|E]. This ancient seeing stone has been invaluable in my hunt for the [onering|E] that I so desire, and I have learned much of the world as it was, as it is, and as it could be.\n\nLong have I sought the One Ring, for only with its power could any hope to compete with the [sauron.GetTitledFirstName], and only I have the wit and power to wield it. And yet, while I have managed to keep this hidden from the White Council, my activity has not gone unnoticed by the Eye in the East.\n\nSince retrieving another stone from [minasithil|E]], Sauron disrupts any attempt to use the Palantir, his very essence filling my mind with an insatiable lust for power.\n\nThe Palantir remains my best chance to find the One, yet I doubt I can evade Sauron's notice for much longer."
 isengard.0102.a:0 "I must find the One Ring and bring order to Middle-earth!"
 isengard.0102.a.tt:0 "You will once more risk seeking the presence of the Ring with the Orthanc-stone."
 isengard.0102.b:0 "This stone has corrupted my heart for long enough..."
 isengard.0102.b.tt:0 "You will give up your lust for power and seek ways to align against Sauron."

 isengard.0103.t:0 "The Palantír"
 isengard.0103.desc:0 "In the darkness of your throne room, the black cloth is lifted, and you reach out towards the crystal ball and command it to show you the [onering|E]. It respects your power and sweeps over the site of the [gladdenfields|E]. A vision of wild marshlands appears, where you have searched ceaselessly to discover the Ring. It is not there. You search further and are directed over [mirkwood|E] to the [seaofrhun|E], where you observe the people of those lands, but someone else is watching.\n\n#V He has found you.#! You perceive the form of a great eye, lidless and wreathed in flame. Within his fortress of Barad-dûr the Dark Lord sees you, his reaching flames pierce through the [palantirone|E] and grasp you, seeking to infiltrate your mind and learn your designs.\n\nAs the stone shows you Sauron's utter conquest of the East and the South, you realise that he does not yet know of your search for the One Ring. You must deceive him by feigning allegiance, or match his will and fight for control of the Palantír."
 isengard.0103.a:0 "Saruman pledges allegiance to you, Lord Sauron..."
 isengard.0103.a.tt:0 "Pledge allegiance to Sauron, for now, and continue your search to claim the One Ring."
 isengard.0103.b:0 "You shall not have my loyalty, Dark Lord!"
 isengard.0103.b.tt:0 "Strive against Sauron, wrest control over the Orthanc Stone."

 decision_bending_the_dunlendings_desc:0 "Ever since the defeat of Wulf at the hands of the Rohirrim centuries ago, the men of Dunland have become a fractured and feuding people.\n\nWhile somewhat primitive, they are strong and hardy folk with a rich history, kinfolk of the men who call me their liege in the valleys around Isengard.\n\nIf I can secure their loyalty, I can use their numbers to bolster my army in the war to come."

 isengard.0201.t:0 "The First Command of Sauron"
 isengard.0201.desc:0 "#V “Build me an army worthy of Mordor.”#!\n\n[sauron.GetFirstName] has issued his first command, bidding me to prepare forces with which to assail [gondor|E] and [rohan|E] from the West, while he shall do so from the East. To that end, he has dispatched some [orcs|E] in secret under their captain [grishnakh.GetFirstName], to provide me with cunning minds bearing smithing and warcraft to aid me in the my efforts. With [grishnakh.GetFirstName] too have come many of the Orcs of the Mountains, furtive but brutal types out of the dark of [moria|E] and the caves of the [mistymountains|E]. These will make fitting raiders and scouts.\n\nBut they will not nearly be enough to bring the Horselords to heel, much less ancient Gondor - more shall be needed. In [orthanc|E] I sit, biding my time and contemplating my next act even as the goblins and orcs begin to carve out great furnaces underground beneath the placid image of the ring of [isengard|E].\n\nLong have the [dunlendings|E] feuded with the [rohirrim|E], and an army loyal wholly to myself would be wise."

 isengard.0210.desc:0 "Ever since the fall of [wulf.GetTitledFirstName] at the hands of [frealaf.GetName], the men of the former [GetTitleByKey('k_dunland').GetName] have been in disarray. Long fragmented into squabbling fiefdoms, its people has languished without a strong ruler.\n\nAnd yet, the land is not without its more influential lords, with a number styling themselves as 'Petty Kings' of their lands. If I were to lend my support to one of these would-be Kings in exchange for their loyalty, I could bolster my army with their forces and secure my western border in one fell swoop.\n\nHowever, talk of negotiating with these wildmen leaves a sour taste in the mouths of many around me, like [warmonger.GetFirstName], who fervently insist that I should instead strike out and use their division against them."

 isengard.0220.t:0 "The Infantry of the Uruk-hai"
 isengard.0220.desc:0 "As the Uruk-hai grow, my thoughts turn to their arming and training. In my mind are two paths for the core infantry of my new army.\n\nThe first is to form traditional orc warbands with many spears and skirmishers, swift and deadly but disadvantaged in pitched battle. They would plunder the land as they spread, terrorising my enemies and sapping their will to fight.\n\nThe latter, and more expensive option, is to have fewer but well-equipped swordsmen and pikes, bearing heavy armor, fit to fight pitched battles on great plains on a more equal footing with my enemies."
 isengard.0220.a:0 "They shall harry my enemies and swarm over the land!"

 isengard.0221.desc:0 "With a decision made on the infantry core of my new army, the wheels of my mind turn to the archers. I see two options here as well - traditional bows, or crossbows.\n\nTraditional bows have their advantages - they are lighter, more compact, less liable to malfunction, and properly trained, can outpace an enemy's fire. On the other hand, they require far more training.\n\nCrossbows are simple - they are easily learned, and can punch harder than many traditional archers. But they run the chance of malfunction, and their rate of fire is slower than a trained archer."
 isengard.0221.a:0 "Traditional bows, will be worth the investment."

 isengard.0222.desc:0 "I have expended much of my resources now - yet my mind still thinks ever more of that with which I may further supplement my forces!\n\nLong have I experimented with a fire which may be lit by command, which can carve through stone and destroy men. But the resources are rare and exotic, and if mishandled could as easily doom my forces as well as my foes.\n\nI could supplement my forces with Warg-riders, as scouts and flankers in battle. Many a battle in history has been decided by the swift mobility of cavalry.\n\nLastly, there are the trolls which dwell in the Misty Mountains which I may draw to my cause and... enhance. They would provide a mighty shock force indeed to lead the vanguard against my foes."

These imposing warriors have risen above their peers, shaving their heads and filling their helmets with human blood, the very scent sending them into an insatiable killing frenzy!\n\nWith fearless ferocity, they charge into battle wearing nothing but a loincoth of chainmail, wielding doubly-bent swords ornamented with spikes to gut and maim any that dare stand in their way.\n\nSeeing their raw potential, I have granted them elevated positions of prestige, branding each with the mark of the White Hand personally, binding their loyalty to me."
