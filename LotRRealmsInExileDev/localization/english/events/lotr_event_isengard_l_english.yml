 isengard.0101.t:0 "The Lord of Isengard"
 isengard.0101.desc:0 "The great Iron Fortress of [isengard|E] has long guarded the southern flank of the [mistymountains|E], the great spire of [orthanc|E] rising from its heart keeping watch over the surrounding valley and the Fords of Isen beyond.\n\nThis great tower was fashioned by builders of the lost realm of [numenor|E], yet it seems not to be made of the craft of Men, but riven from the bones of the earth in the ancient torment of the hills.\n\nIt was at the crowning of [frealaf.GetName] that I appeared, following the death of [helm.GetFirstNameNicknamed] and his sons at the hands of [wulf.GetFirstName] and his Dunlendings. I brought gifts, and sang great praise of the valour of the [rohirrim|E], quickly earning the love of new King.\n\nSeeking greater security against Dunlending raids, the King convinced [beren.GetName] to grant me the keys to the abandoned tower of Orthanc, to act as a Warden over the western borderlands and a representative of the Steward."
 isengard.0101.a:0 "And so have I remained for the last 240 years..."

 isengard.0102.t:0 "My Search for the One"
 isengard.0102.desc:0 "Since taking residence in [isengard|E], I have uncovered many of its secrets, the greatest prize of all being the Orthanc-stone, one of the seven [palantir|E] of [numenor|E]. This ancient seeing stone has been invaluable in my hunt for the [onering|E] that I so desire, and I have learned much of the world as it was, as it is, and as it could be.\n\nLong have I sought the One Ring, for only with its power could any hope to compete with the [sauron.GetTitledFirstName], and only I have the wit and power to wield it. And yet, while I have managed to keep this hidden from the White Council, my activity has not gone unnoticed by the Eye in the East.\n\nSince retrieving another stone from [minasithil|E]], Sauron disrupts any attempt to use the Palantir, his very essence filling my mind with an insatiable lust for power.\n\nThe Palantir remains my best chance to find the One, yet I doubt I can evade Sauron's notice for much longer."
 isengard.0102.a:0 "I must find the One Ring and bring order to Middle-earth!"
 isengard.0102.a.tt:0 "You will once more risk seeking the presence of the Ring with the Orthanc-stone."
 isengard.0102.b:0 "This stone has corrupted my heart for long enough..."
 isengard.0102.b.tt:0 "You will give up your lust for power and seek ways to align against Sauron."

 isengard.0103.t:0 "The Palantír"
 isengard.0103.desc:0 "In the darkness of your throne room, the black cloth is lifted, and you reach out towards the crystal ball and command it to show you the [onering|E]. It respects your power and sweeps over the site of the [gladdenfields|E]. A vision of wild marshlands appears, where you have searched ceaselessly to discover the Ring. It is not there. You search further and are directed over [mirkwood|E] to the [seaofrhun|E], where you observe the people of those lands, but someone else is watching.\n\n#V He has found you.#! You perceive the form of a great eye, lidless and wreathed in flame. Within his fortress of Barad-dûr the Dark Lord sees you, his reaching flames pierce through the [palantirone|E] and grasp you, seeking to infiltrate your mind and learn your designs.\n\nAs the stone shows you Sauron's utter conquest of the East and the South, you realise that he does not yet know of your search for the One Ring. You must deceive him by feigning allegiance, or match his will and fight for control of the Palantír."
 isengard.0103.a:0 "Saruman pledges allegiance to you, Lord Sauron..."
 isengard.0103.a.tt:0 "Pledge allegiance to Sauron, for now, and continue your search to claim the One Ring."
 isengard.0103.b:0 "You shall not have my loyalty, Dark Lord!"
 isengard.0103.b.tt:0 "Strive against Sauron, wrest control over the Orthanc Stone."
