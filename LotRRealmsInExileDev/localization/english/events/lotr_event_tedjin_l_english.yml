 tedjin.0100.t:0 "The Confederation in Crisis"
 tedjin.0100.desc:0 "For the past 50 years, Ayal of the House of Thezij has judiciously balanced the powers both external and internal within the Tedjin Confederacy. His long-standing friendship with the house of Azumen has ensured internal support and stability for his long reign, cemented by the marriage of his son and heir to their eldest daughter. \n\nIn foreign affairs, he has championed a cautious and judicious policy. Under his reign, few great battles have been fought, but Tedjin mercenaries have fought far afield, bringing glory and fame to their houses. Now though, in the twilight of his years, it all threatens to unravel. His son and heir, Bór, returned from his battles abroad shaken in his convictions of his people and their ways. Converting to the Batan-an-Izindi, his son is now seized by a fierce desire to reform their people, and to abandon their old ways. \n\nThis has roused the ire of the conservatives of the confederation. Now in the last embers of his days, Ayal can only watch in horror as all the plans of his generation to ensure lasting stability turn to ash..."
