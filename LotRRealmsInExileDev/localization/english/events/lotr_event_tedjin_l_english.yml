 ### Tedjin Introduction Events ###
 tedjin.0100.t:0 "The Confederation in Crisis"
 tedjin.0100.desc:0 "For the past 50 years, Ayal of the House of Thezij has judiciously balanced the powers both external and internal within the Tedjin Confederacy. His long-standing friendship with the house of Azumen has ensured internal support and stability for his long reign, cemented by the marriage of his son and heir to their eldest daughter. \n\nIn foreign affairs, he has championed a cautious and judicious policy. Under his reign, few great battles have been fought, but Tedjin mercenaries have fought far afield, bringing glory and fame to their houses. Now though, in the twilight of his years, it all threatens to unravel. His son and heir, Bór, returned from his battles abroad shaken in his convictions of his people and their ways. Converting to the Batan-an-Izindi, his son is now seized by a fierce desire to reform their people, and to abandon their old ways. \n\nThis has roused the ire of the conservatives of the confederation. Now in the last embers of his days, Ayal can only watch in horror as all the plans of his generation to ensure lasting stability turn to ash..."

 tedjin.0101.a:0 "I don't have enough time anymore..."
 
 tedjin.0102.t:0 "A Son's Tribute"
 tedjin.0102.desc:0 "Father, rest well. Many years you shepherded our people, calm and sage. You always sought to ensure tranquility among them, but tranquility can no longer be enough.\n\nOur people live as mere hired arms for greater realms, our honor and pride degraded! We must alter our course and set right our path, if we are to rise once more as a people proud and free.\n\nMy dream is the inheritance of our family, nay our people. I shall lead us down the path you could not. Rest well, Ayal, great peacekeeper - I shall carry our torch from here."
 tedjin.0102.a:0 "Now where to begin?"
 
 tedjin.0103.t:0 "The Unexpected Heir"
 tedjin.0103.desc:0 "I never expected to inherit rule so soon! Father was young when he died, and I thought I had many more years before thoughts of lordship would have to be contemplated.\n\nMy father always spoke so passionately about his dream - I cannot allow it to die with him.\n\nBut, for all my love of him, he was rash, and rather blunt at times. Reform can come, if I want it, but I must proceed carefully from here on out..."
 tedjin.0103.a:0 "In time I shall bring them to heel."
 tedjin.0103.b:0 "Though it pains me, I must relent."
 tedjin.0103.c:0 "Why waste time swaying those who cannot be?"
 
 tedjin.0105.t:0 "The Confederacy Splits!"
 tedjin.0105.desc:0 "In the face of the continued defiance of conservative lords, [ROOT.GetCharacter.GetTitledFirstName] has formally absolved them of their oaths of loyalty to [ROOT.GetCharacter.GetHerHim], and bid them to elect one of their own number to lead their own realm.\n\n[ROOT.GetCharacter.GetTitledFirstName] has taken those who agree with [ROOT.GetCharacter.GetHerHis] reforms, religious and political, and created a new kingdom: Sôriya.\n\nThough smaller than the Tedjin Confederacy, it is assuredly more stable. Time shall tell what happens between this new kingdom and its neighbors..."
 tedjin.0105.a:0 "Good riddance! Let them have their backwards ways..."
 tedjin.0105.b:0 "Is he allowed to do that?"
 
 tedjin.0106.t:0 "The Child Lord"
 tedjin.0106.desc:0 "The ascension of a child-lord has rocked the confederacy. With [ROOT.GetCharacter.GetTitledFirstName] still well below the age of majority, the regional confederation lords have already begun to jockey for power, refusing to swear their oaths of loyalty on account of [ROOT.GetCharacter.GetHerHis] family's recent conversion to the Batan an-Izindi.\n\nWhile they still hold power in Thri Zirakan and the local areas there, the dynasty's ability to enforce unity across the confederacy has dwindled down to nothing. For all intents and purposes, the Tedjin Confederacy has been dissolved. "
 tedjin.0106.a:0 "Make the mean men go away!"
 
 tedjin.0107.t:0 "The Last of House Thezij"
 tedjin.0107.desc:0 "Tarika, Daughter of Ayal, never expected to rule over the Tedjin. Now one of the last of her line, her sons shall not bear that name - it is the end of an era.\n\nThe ascension of Ayal's daughter has brought a return to the conservative and pragmatic policy of his days. However, the lords of Kes Ebb have refused to acknowledge the return to the old status quo, and did not journey to swear fealty to her!\n\nInstead, they have turned South and sought the protection of Felaya. While many of the confederacy lords fume at this insult, it also seems unlikely they shall yet be able to bring vengeance upon the perfidious lords at this time..."
 tedjin.0107.a:0 "Why did this have to fall to me?"
 
 tedjin.0108.t:0 "The Death of Ayal"
 tedjin.0108.desc:0 "Ayal has taken his last breath, and now the confederacy is led by [ROOT.GetCharacter.GetTitledFirstName]. Likely this will bring a return to traditional Tedjin mores and policy.\n\nIn response, the reformist lords of Kes Ebb have seceded from the Confederacy, and bent the knee to Felaya instead. Time shall tell what will come from this change."
 tedjin.0108.a:0 "A return to normal, I guess..."

 tedjin.0111.t:0 "A Wife's Plea"
 tedjin.0111.desc:0 "Bulga, my wife and sister of my former friend Azumen, begged me to allow her to go speak to plead with her brother to relent and convert.\n\nI do not see what good it will do... "
 tedjin.0111.a:0 "...but she can try!"
 
 tedjin.0112.t:0 "A Sister's Plea"
 tedjin.0112.desc:0 "Bulga, my sister and wife of my once-friend Bór, has come and begged me to relent my feud with her husband. She implores me to remember the friendship we once had, and what great things we and our people could accomplish united behind Bór's vision. What say I?"
 tedjin.0112.a:0 "Maladûm knows no compromise!"
 tedjin.0112.b:0 "For my sister alone, I will relent."

 tedjin.0113.t:0 "The Hardliner Softens"
 tedjin.0113.desc:0 "Azumen, one of the Confederacy's strongest Katajans and long seen as leader of the conservative faction resisting Bór's reformist ideals, has given up his traditional Maladûmite faith and reconciled with his former friend and new Lord.\n\nWith this unexpected development, conservative opposition to Bór's reforms has weakened significantly with many other conservative lords forced under pressure to reconsider their position."
 tedjin.0113.a:0 "Finally, they begin to understand my vision."
 tedjin.0113.b:0 "Times change, but family is forever..."
 tedjin.0113.c:0 "That was a close call!"
 tedjin.0113.d:0 "Maladûm knows no compromise!"
 tedjin.0113.e:0 "Our cause is lost, I must move on."

 tedjin.0114.t:0 "Crossroads of Destiny"
 tedjin.0114.desc:0 "The pleas of my wife Bulga for Azumen to reconcile with me has failed. With the steadfast emnity of the house of Azumen assured, conservatives will rally behind him to oppose my reforms.\n\nI shall have to choose carefully how to proceed..."
 tedjin.0114.a:0 "There is but one path to our people's future!"
 tedjin.0114.b:0 "I shall learn from my father's example."
 tedjin.0114.c:0 "The Confederacy is not ready for change."
 tedjin.0114.d:0 "Obstinate fools! I shall lead the wise to a new path, apart from them."
 
 tedjin.0115.t:0 "The Tedjin Dispute"
 tedjin.0115.desc:0 "The Tedjin Confederacy is roiling with unrest, as the ambitious new Kataj Bór seeks to push forward political and religious reforms. In response, the more conservative lords of the confederacy have begun to covertly resist Bór's efforts at every turn. In fact, there are significant signs that it may erupt into full civil strife.\n\nWhile we might quickly dismiss the internal squabbles of desert tribesmen, the Tedjin are renowned fighters and mercenaries, and occupy a vital buffer between Umbar and Bellakar. Should the reactionary lords succeed in overthrowing Bór, their ambitions will surely turn South once more.\n\nAs such, it might be wise to attempt to ensure the faction aligned with our interests succeeds in this struggle..."
 tedjin.0115.a:0 "Perhaps we should intervene to keep them from our doorstep..."
 tedjin.0115.b:0 "With my support, perhaps they could harass my enemies in the South."
 tedjin.0115.tt:0 "Tedjin Civil War support decision unlocked."

 tedjin.0131.t:0 "The Felayan Emissary"
 tedjin.0131.desc:0 "Keeping an eye on the brewing instability, an emissary of the First Lord of Felaya has arrived at your court. Speaking of their sympathies for your attempt to spread enlightenment throughout your people, they come bearing a proposal mediated by the Izinidubeth himself.\n\nFor many years, Felaya has yearned for the return of the lost lands of Kes Ebb. Should you be willing to return these sundered lands to her, Felaya will gladly send many men and commanders to fight to ensure the House of Thezij stands triumphant in the brewing storm."
 tedjin.0131.a:0 "If that is the price for such aid, I shall pay."
 tedjin.0131.b:0 "My apologies, but I cannot abandon a vassal..."

 tedjin.0136.t:0 "The Bargain of the Corsairs"
 tedjin.0136.desc:0 "The corsairs of Mardruak are a fickle lot, with no true loyalty to any but themselves. The [insert title] of Nykkea has approached us with an offer - relinquish the traditional lands of [insert titles] to his domain, and he will send us large companies of battle-hardened corsairs to assist us against the reactionaries. What should we do?"
 tedjin.0136.a:0 "A hard bargain, but a fair one."
 tedjin.0136.b:0 "We will not give an inch of land to pirates!"
 
 tedjin.9999.t:0 "Death of Ayal - Bór rules the Confederacy"
 tedjin.9999.desc:0 "Ayal, lord of the Tedjin, has passed. For many years he pursued a conservative policy of internal stability. Now, however, his son Bór reigns as lord of the Confederacy, and a new era is set to dawn upon them. For Bór is not his father. He is driven by a fervent belief in the necessity of reform for both the Confederacy and his people. Time shall tell if his ambitions shall be realized, or if the conservative lords of the confederacy will force him to temper his approach."
 tedjin.9999.a:0 "Let's see what happens next..."
