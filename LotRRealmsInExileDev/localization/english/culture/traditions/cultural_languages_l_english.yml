Following the Akallabêth the exiles of Númenor enlarged and enriched Westron with many Elvish loanwords, mostly from Númenórean Sindarin.\n\nDue to the influence of the Dunédain, Westron became known as Common Speach in the Westlands due to its popularity, with Dwarves, Orcs and Elves speaking either the dialect in its pure form or dialects of it."
