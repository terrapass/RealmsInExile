 tulwang_struggle.0101.desc:0 "The Bay of Tûlwang has long been a contested region. The lucrative trade flowing forth from the Bôzisha-Dâr is a prize over which much blood has been shed. Pirates prey upon the trade convoys like vultures in the roost. The Bôzisha-Mîraz and the Rây are troubled, both within and without, torn by religious discord and foreign interests.\n\n"
