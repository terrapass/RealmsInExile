  ### Leofring Fae Court###
 faith_fey_court:0 "Fey Court of Foldewyn"
 faith_fey_court_adj:0 "Fey Court"
 faith_fey_court_desc:0 "Leofring veneration revolves around the king and queen of the Fey, Béma and Foldewyn. Béma ever has been a friend of mankind and taught the Leofrings to ride and gifted them their herds. He is kindly and quick to forgiveness, though often wandering and absent as well. While Béma roams afar, his wife Foldewyn, mighty in her own right, reigns over the fey in her court of starlight. \n\nDwelling in the forest of the mist, the Leofring believe that Foldewyn bears a fickle mood, proud, and slow to forgive the mistakes of mankind. Her favour is perilous to acquire, though rich when gotten; for few come again from her forest, and not unchanged. Priestesses intercede with her fey on mankind's behalf, hoping to earn her favour and not her ire. If her ire is raised, men have been said to walk into the mist, enchanted, never to be seen again."

 faith_withered_court_desc:0 "Once, the King of the Dark Fey ruled a court of twilight, rivalling that of his brother Béma. His reign was solitary but fair from his halls beneath the hills. But his power was not that of his brother, and he and his people withered, and his halls, once fair and green, because a desolation. The dark fey rose again in dread visage, spiteful towards the living that thrived while they withered. \n\nNow darkness comes forth from that hill, a choking malice upon all who would dare approach it. The restless fey have turned fell and taken up twisted forms. Bony hands stretch forth to grasp the living and take our life for their own. Only through grand sacrifices can they be appeased, lest the malice of their dread king fall upon us, and our ruin come."
