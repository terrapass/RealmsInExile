 faith_broadbeams_desc:0 "The Houses of the [bluemountains|E] [dwarves|E] have dwelled alongside the elves of [beleriand|E] and later [lindon|E] since time immemorial. Interaction, influence, and even a degree of friendship was inevitable, and the Broadbeams and many Firebeards developed from these dialogues a deeper understanding of the nature of their father and creator [mahalcharacter|E] "The Maker" and his wife [yavannacharacter|E] "Queen of the Earth." \n\nWhile all [dwarves|E] treat the bounties of stone, the majesties of the living rock and the splendor of caverns bursting with gems with respect and gravity, few among their number truly respect the other bounties the earth can grant, that which is green and grown. But those who follow the teachings of Kemnêl-mesêm hold a deep respect towards all the bounties of the earth, whether it be priceless jewels or common plants, percieving that all are bound up in the great song of the earth."

 faith_firebeards_adherent_plural:0 "Mazalikân"
 faith_firebeards_desc:0 "Practitioners of "Eternal Memory" are those Firebeards who remember every transgression (Percieved or real) done to their house. Reclusively living in the deeps of Buzra Dum, at the very heart of the hold of defiant flame, where the Sunset Caverns lie. Well known for their rigidly orthodox adherence to the original teachings of [mahalcharacter|E] \n\nWether it be the elves of [lindon|E] for their withholding of the Nauglamir, a precious necklace crafted by Nogrod dwarves with a [silmaril|E]. Their own creator's wife [yavannacharacter|E] for sending her wild and savage Ents to slaughter the Firebeards who siezed the necklace from the elves of Doriath, or even their fellow kin. Those who do not hold the Mebelkhags responsible, are just as much at fault as any Elf"

 faith_stiffbeards_desc:0 "All Dwarven houses believe in the fabled Halls of [mahalcharacter|E]. A sacred place in [valinor|E] set aside for [mahalcharacter|E]'s children to await the end of the world and rebuild it at his side. Those who follow Id-Ahlâth Darâg "The Tombs of The Divine", hold that these halls are the very birthplaces of the seven fathers of the Dwarven houses. \n\nMainly practiced by the Stiffbeards of the far north. All Mabiratadnûn "They who remain" return their dead to the birthplace of their house. No matter the distance. This has resulted in the extraordinarily stubborn and sedentary nature of the Stiffbeards. Nearly all of Thúlin the Swift's house have remained in their home since before the first dawn. Those few who have fled the endless hoards of northern foes, must all make the journey home one final time"
