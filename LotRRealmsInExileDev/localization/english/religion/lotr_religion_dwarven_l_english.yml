 faith_broadbeams_desc:0 "The Houses of the [bluemountains|E] [dwarves|E] have dwelled alongside the elves of [beleriand|E] and later [lindon|E] since time immemorial. Interaction, influence, and even a degree of friendship was inevitable, and the Broadbeams and many Firebeards developed from these dialogues a deeper understanding of the nature of their father and creator [mahalcharacter|E] "The Maker" and his wife [yavannacharacter|E] "Queen of the Earth." \n\nWhile all [dwarves|E] treat the bounties of stone, the majesties of the living rock and the splendor of caverns bursting with gems with respect and gravity, few among their number truly respect the other bounties the earth can grant, that which is green and grown. But those who follow the teachings of Kemnêl-mesêm hold a deep respect towards all the bounties of the earth, whether it be priceless jewels or common plants, percieving that all are bound up in the great song of the earth."
