 sauronic_religion_desc:0 "After [morgoth|E] was cast into the [void|E] at the end of the War of Wrath, [sauroncharacter|E] was the most powerful of his lieutants to escape the justice of the Valar. He first cast himself as the heir of Morgoth, and then as indeed a god of equal standing (if not greater) than Morgoth himself."

 lidless_eye_desc:0 "Concealed within his fortress, the Lord of [mordor|E] sees all. His gaze pierces cloud, shadow, earth, and flesh. An eye, lidless, wreathed in flame. A god upon Middle-Earth, all shall revere him: [sauroncharacter|E] the Great, Lord of the Earth! \n\nThe official state religion of Sauron's empire, the Cult of the Lidless Eye goes by many names, but all its variants revolve around submission and acknowledgement of the divine authority of Sauron, the Lord of the Earth. His sacraments are administered through sorcerer-priests trained in the Morgul-arts, and the high-priest is the Steward of Barad-dûr, the Mouth of Sauron."

The time of the Orc has come! \n\nThe [orcs|E] of [mordor|E], living under the power of [sauroncharacter|E], view with hatred all other races, desiring their lands and their riches for their own. They think the world should rightfully belong to orc-kind, since they are the strongest."

 red_eye_cult_adherent_plural:0 "Naukdshu-Fai Cultists"
 red_eye_cult_desc:0 "The gaze of the Great Eye is the fount of wisdom, the crucible of understanding, the book in which the secrets of the deep magics are hid! Lesser orcs shrivel and break beneath its burning light, but we comprehend it for the glory it is! We are unworthy of its gaze - but we might prove ourselves worthy. We must work harder, create ever greater magics, forge mightier weapons for the great plan of the Eye! \n\nThe Naukdshu-Fai (Red Eye Cult) is a fringe orcish group obsessed with sorcery and the 'blessing' of being pierced by the gaze of the Great Eye. For their maniacal ravings, they were eventually forced into the hills by their saner (by orc standards) kin. Formed by a particularly zealous Orc-shaman who had acquired small scraps of sorcery texts, they desire to prove their worth to [sauroncharacter|E], in the hope he will bless them and acknowledge their teachings."

 melkorite_adherent_plural:0 "Children of Mulkhêr"
 melkorite_desc:0 "[mulkhercharacter|E] created mankind in His image, strong, beautiful, and immortal. Additionally, He crafted the world for them to inhabit. But the foul [avaloigods|E], jealous of Mulkhêr's works and his nobility, stole immortality from mankind. Slinking away to their fortress-land of the far west, they made the [eledaim|E] in their image as Mulkhêr had with mankind. Thus, did the Avalôi usurp the righteous place of mankind with their puppets, and in time this treachery cast down Mulkhêr himself, banishing him beyond the world. But the Great Lord shall come again, and the world's wrongs shall be righted, the false masters overthrown, and the dominion of Mankind shall come at last. \n\nThe worship of Morgoth was introduced to [numenor|E] through the treachery of [sauroncharacter|E], only becoming practiced there after the surrender and captivity of Sauron. Sauron became its High-Priest in the Great Temple of Armenelos, preaching his message of dark salvation to the fearful [numenoreans|E]. After the [akallabeth|E], the cult endured in some of the southern Númenórean colonies of Middle-Earth for a short while, with it all but dying out by the early Third Age."

 creed_of_man_adherent_plural:0 "Anîhin"
 creed_of_man_desc:0 "In the darkest of corners of the old empire of Númenór, a tale is maintained. Mankind, in the dawn of the world, had been threatened by the Devourer, and saved only by the Lord of the Dark, who taught them out to subjugate it, and make it their servant. This Dark Lord was none other than He the Ârûwanâ ancestors named Mulkhêr. But though the Ârûwanâi had worshipped Him, they had failed. \n\n The Nunazhme taught that the Poganin (Heathens/Unworthy, the Númenóreans) were corrupters of Men, and that through their own hubris they had destroyed themselves. Though right to acknowledge the Lord of the Dark, they had been led astray by their craven fear of Death, the Fate of Men, to make war on the [valargods|E]. [sauroncharacter|E], the Nunazhme believed, had set this temptation before the Poganin to test their worthiness. They failed the test. \n\nNow though, the Advocates of the Zâur an-Anî preach, the world was changing again. Soon the climactic battle shall come, and the faithful shall prove their devotion to the Lord of the Dark, and raise anew his ruined temple."

 white_hand_cult_adherent_plural:0 "Servants of the White Hand"
 white_hand_cult_desc:0 "A new power is rising. The Elder Days are gone. The Middle Days are passing. The Younger Days are beginning. And it is Saruman who shall order this new age to peace and prosperity, he alone who possesses the wisdom to order the world. \n\nArguably not really a religion so much as a political philosophy, The Cult of the White Hand is an ideology which emphasizes the inability for regular rulers to properly order the lives of themselves or their people. They require a guide, and as greatest of the Wise, that role rightfully belongs to Saruman, mightiest of the Istari."

 way_of_strength_adj:0 "Pardahûnúk"
 way_of_strength_adherent:0 "Orc"
 way_of_strength_adherent_plural:0 "Orcs"
 way_of_strength_desc:0 "Rejecting service to the Dark Lord, the Pardahûnúk refers to the orcs who instead harbor desires to take that place themselves. Not really a religion, it is much more a very crude philosophy, born as much of spite and instinct as any sort of larger worldview. \n\nIn short, it is this - the weak shall serve the strong. There are no depths to which one cannot sink in the name of seizing power, of becoming one’s own lord and master. In time even the strongest stumble and their foes slay them; then a new orc shall take his place at the top of the peak, and the cycle begins anew. This is an eternal cycle, one which the Orcs shall perpetrate unto the ending of the world."
