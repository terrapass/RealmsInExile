A god upon Middle-Earth, all shall revere him: Sauron the Great, Lord of the Earth! \n\nThe official state religion of Sauron's empire, the Cult of the Lidless Eye goes by many names, but all its variants revolve around submission and acknowledgement of the divine authority of Sauron, the Lord of the Earth. His sacraments are administred through sorcerer-priests trained in the morgul-arts, and the head of the faith is the Steward of Barad-dûr, the Mouth of Sauron."

 red_eye_cult_desc:0 "The gaze of the Great Eye is the fount of wisdom, the crucible of understanding, the book in which the secrets of the deep magics are hid! Lesser orcs shrivel and break beneath its burning light, but we comprehend it for the glory it is! We are unworthy of its gaze - but we might prove ourselves worthy. We must work harder, create ever greater magics, forge mightier weapons for the great plan of the Eye! \n\nThe Naukdshu-Fai (Red Eye Cult) is a fringe orcish group obsessed with sorcery and the 'blessing' of being pierced by the gaze of the Great Eye. For their maniacal ravings, they were eventually forced into the hills by their saner (by orc standards) kin. Formed by a particularly zealous Orc-shaman who had acquired small scraps of sorcery texts, they desire to prove their worth to Sauron, in the hope he will bless them and acknowledge their teachings."
