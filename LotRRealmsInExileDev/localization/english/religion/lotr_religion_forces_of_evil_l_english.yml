A god upon Middle-Earth, all shall revere him: Sauron the Great, Lord of the Earth! \n\nThe official state religion of Sauron's empire, the Cult of the Lidless Eye goes by many names, but all its variants revolve around submission and acknowledgement of the divine authority of Sauron, the Lord of the Earth. His sacraments are administred through sorcerer-priests trained in the morgul-arts, and the head of the faith is the Steward of Barad-dûr, the Mouth of Sauron."
