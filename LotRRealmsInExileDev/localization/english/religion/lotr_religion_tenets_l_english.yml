  tenet_primacy_of_manwe_desc:0 "Manwë Súlimo, the Elder King, is the supreme ruler of all Arda, the viceregent of Eru in the world incarnate, and Lord of the Breath of Arda. The winds, airs and birds are his servants, and his presence is felt wherever the four winds blow. His palace, Ilmarin, sits upon the peak of Taniquetil, where the four winds bring all things said upon Arda to his ear. Of all the Ainur, he is said to be closest to the mind of Illuvatar. As the Elder King, he is the natural patron of kings and righteous rulers."
  tenet_primacy_of_varda_name:0 "Primacy of Varda"
  tenet_primacy_of_varda_desc:0 "Varda Elentári is the wife of Manwë, Queen of the Ainur, the Kindler, she who made the stars, most dearly beloved of the Valar amongst the Eldar. Beautiful beyond all words, light is her dominion, and everywhere the light of the stars shine she sees from her throne in the palaces of Ilmarin upon Taniquetil. From the beginning, she had been the most implacable foe of Morgoth, and she perceives most keenly the true nature of others. The very mention of her name is a curse upon evil, and she most amongst the powers is called upon for aid and strength in dire times. Amongst all the Powers, she might be said to be the true patron to any that stands resolute against the tide of Darkness."
  tenet_primacy_of_ulmo_name:0 "Primacy of Ulmo"
  tenet_primacy_of_ulmo_desc:0 "Ulmo is the lord of the seas and waters of Arda. His power dwells in the oceans and the rivers, and he is the most deeply instructed in the art of music, with it being said that an echo of the Music of the Ainur can be heard in the deeps of the ocean. He seldom involves himself in the councils of the Powers, preferring his undersea domains. Of all the Powers, he feels most keenly the pains of the Children through his waters, and alone of the Powers has never abandoned them. He is friend and patron foremost to those that dwell near his domain, coastal peoples, fishermen, and sailors."
  tenet_primacy_of_yavanna_name:0 "Primacy of Yavanna"
  tenet_primacy_of_yavanna_desc:0 "Yavanna Kementári is the Queen of the Earth, the Giver of Fruits – in her domain lies all things which grow. She made the Two Trees after the destruction of the Lamps made by her husband, Aulë, and from her pleas for protection of her plants were born the Onodrim. Yavanna is the Power responsible for the bounty of the fields, and she rejoices in the growing of plants. She despairs in their destruction, counting them her children, although she begrudgingly accepts that the Children coming into their dominion shall do such. She is the patroness of the farmer and all agrarian workers."
  tenet_primacy_of_aule_name:0 "Primacy of Aulë"
  tenet_primacy_of_aule_desc:0 "Aulë the Smith is the greatest craftsmen of the Ainur, the one who wrought the foundations of the earth and rose up the mountains. He rejoices in the making of things, but seeks not their dominion, rejoicing in collaboration and the teaching of others. The minerals and jewels of the earth are of his design, ornamentation of the greater creation. Aulë is the patron, teacher, and friend of all who desire to make without destruction or dominion, lord of craftsmen and builders."
  tenet_primacy_of_nienna_name:0 "Primacy of Nienna"
  tenet_primacy_of_nienna_desc:0 "Nienna Núri, the Lady of Mercy,  is the mourner who cries tears for the world and its pains. In her is the ability to be steadfast in sorrow, courageous in grief, and to understand that such pain is natural, and that those that suffer should be comforted. In her is the pity, and the hope, that changes the world, the pity that the more jaded would call folly, the pity and hope that keeps believing that there is good that can be found and redeemed, even in deep darkness. She is the comforter of the bereaved and the deceased, the advocate for the condemned. All who suffer are her charge, and those that follow her take on a similarly heavy burden."
  tenet_primacy_of_orome_name:0 "Primacy of Oromë"
  tenet_primacy_of_orome_desc:0 "Oromë Aldaron, the Great Rider, is the lord of wild beasts, the hunt, horses, riders, and dogs. He rejoices in the hunt, both of animals and of evil. He alone roamed Middle-Earth during the Sleep of Yavanna, and he found the first Eldar at its end and led them to Valinor. He is terrible in his wrath, and his horn strikes terror into all evil that hears it. Those that hear it know that the end was upon them, for none can escape the bow of Oromë once he has set it to strike down evil. He is the patron of horsemen and hunters, and dear friend to archers and foes of the Darkness."
  tenet_primacy_of_mandos_name:0 "Primacy of Mandos"
  tenet_primacy_of_mandos_desc:0 "Námo Fëanturi, more commonly known as Mandos the Doomsman, is lord of the Halls of the Dead and pronouncer of Fate. Of all the Powers, Námo sees most clearly the Song in its entirety, the possible futures and the wangling ties of destiny that bind Arda together. He is the most grim of the Powers and speaks rarely, and usually only at the prompting of Manwë his king. Mandos is patron to none but the dead, but those of powerful foresight might feel a small kinship to the Doomsman and the heavy weight he bears."
  tenet_primacy_of_este_name:0 "Primacy of Estë"
  tenet_primacy_of_este_desc:0 "Estë the Gentle is the wife of Irmo, and with him she is the great healer of the Valar. In her is the power to heal wounds and weariness of the world, though she cannot heal a heart which does not wish to heal. She is kindly in her manner, desiring to mend the wrongs of the world and ends its hurts. She is the patron of healers."
  tenet_primacy_of_lorien_name:0 "Primacy of Lórien"
  tenet_primacy_of_lorien_desc:0 "Irmo Fëanturi, known perhaps better as Lorien the Dreamer, Lord of Desires, is lord of the Gardens of Lorien and guider of dreams and visions. His gardens are respites of healing and safety from the woes and pains of the world, and though rare, might be found by a blessed few amongst Men and Elves. Irmo is the patron of spirits and dreams but accepts all who need rest and healing into his gardens."
  tenet_primacy_of_vaire_name:0 "Primacy of Vairë"
  tenet_primacy_of_vaire_desc:0 "Vairë is the wife of Namo of Mandos, and to her is charged the task of recording all of the history of Arda, beginning to end, through her weavings. The halls of Mandos are draped in these tapestries, and the halls grow ever bigger as the Story grows in time and depth. She herself does not interfere with the Story, and thus, with the living, but loremasters and scholars look to her for inspiration and guidance."
  tenet_primacy_of_tulkas_name:0 "Primacy of Tulkas"
  tenet_primacy_of_tulkas_desc:0 "Tulkas Astaldo was the last of the Ainur to descend into Arda, in order to aid his kin in their war against the Black Foe. Tulkas delights in deeds of prowess and strength, such as wrestling and fighting. But for all his warlike behavior, he is far from dreadful; he laughs heartily in sports and war alike. He is a hardy friend, slow to anger but also slow to forgive. He should not be sought for counsel, for he lives in the present, not mindful of the lessons of the past. He is patron to warriors and those that engage in sports and contests of strength."
  tenet_primacy_of_vana_name:0 "Primacy of Vána"
  tenet_primacy_of_vana_desc:0 "Vairë is the wife of Namo of Mandos, and to her is charged the task of recording all of the history of Arda, beginning to end, through her weavings. The halls of Mandos are draped in these tapestries, and the halls grow ever bigger as the Story grows in time and depth. She herself does not interfere with the Story, and thus, with the living, but loremasters and scholars look to her for inspiration and guidance."

However, they shall fight bitterly to defend their forests and their homes, so face their poisoned arrows at your own peril!"
