They respect and revere the Powers, and invoke them to aid them, but they do not worship them - worship is reserved for [erutheone|El] alone, and His name is deemed too sacred for all but the most of important vows."

 faith_calaquendi_desc:0 "The Calaquendi are the High-Elves of the [uttermostwest|E], who maintain a pure tradition of the world's founding as passed down to them by the Powers themselves during their days in Valinor. \n\nIn the days before Ea was wrought, there was Eru, the One, who in Arda is named Ilúvatar. From him were born the Ainur, and the Ainur by the conduction of Ilúvatar wrought a great song. But Melkor, mightiest of the Ainur sought to make the song his own and usurp Ilúvatar and so discord entered it, the root of all the worlds ills. At last, when they were finished, Ilúvatar showed the Ainur a vision of what their song had made, before speaking one word - Eä - be. And so, the world was. \n\nSome of the Ainur decided to descend into Arda and dwell therein, and the mightiest of these were the Valar. But in time, out of pride and jealousy Melkor too followed, and war was made between the powers ere the Children awoke. At long last, the labours of the Ainur completed, the Children of Ilúvatar awoke to a world broken from what it was, but ready for their habitation."

 faith_lomequendi_desc:0 "Lómëquendi is a term given by the [noldorelvesexiles|E] to the [sindarelves|E] and the other elves of [greatjourney|El] who did not reach Valinor - the Elves of Twilight. Enriched in their knowledge by long dealings with their Amanyar kin and the Maia Melian, the Lómëquendi are remarkably like the Calaquendi in their religious customs. However, they still maintain their own distinct traditions, such as a greater tendency to perform rites and ceremonies of passage - a hunt might be dedicated to Oromë or a harvest to Yavanna, on a more formal, ritualistic level than the informal invocations and thanks offered by the Calaquendi."

 faith_moriquendi_desc:0 "Moriquendi is a term given by the Calaquendi to those that refused to leave Cuiviénen after the summons of the Valar. While they have little knowledge of the Powers, they are not unaware of the truth of the One, and worship Him in their own way. They sing and write of the light of the stars or the sound of falling water, the sweetness of fruit or the luminescence of gems from deep within the earth. With music and dance most of all they rejoice in the magnificence of Eä. \n\nIf they have not the high lore of the Eldar of the Uttermost West, and their prayers are not spoken to the Powers, the One surely cannot find fault in the pure spirit of their worship."

Though not always perfect, the [ainurgods|E] strive to live up to the expectations of the creator, and to rule fair and justly. \n\nAþāraphelūn is one of the few known words of Valarin, the language of the powers, said to be unspeakable for those not of the Ainur. It translates to 'Annointed Dwelling', the world of [ardaconcept|E], which the Ainur made in the Great Song under the conduction of [eruiluvatar|E]."
