 faith_haruze_desc:0 "In the harsh desert wastes of Near-Harad, the serpent-king of Night, Khäz-gramaze, is praised as the protector of Harad and her people, waging war unending to preserve them from the perverse cruelties of the sea-people and their temperamental god, Malíciam."

 faith_jelut_desc:0 "In the burning desert, few things are permanent, and certainty is scarce. One thing that is certain, however, is the light of Gurzil as he travels across the sky. Though his gaze can be harsh and biting, his stalwart presence also provides comfort and solace to his people as they cross the vast deserts of Harad in their great caravans. Though the world should change, and empires fall, Gurzil's path remains, and so too shall his people."

 faith_lurmsakun_adherent_plural:0 "Makussetites"
 faith_lurmsakun_desc:0 "The god of death and prophecy is an ever-present weight among the people of sparse Lûrmsakûn. Terrorized by the neighbouring Variags of Khand, the people of Lurmsakun had to come to terms with mortality and death from a very early stage of their society. And strangely indeed, this has resulted in a faith which distant Gondor remarked as 'remarkedly spiritually enlightened', for the adherents of Makusset have come to understand and accept their own mortality, and the transient nature of the world.\n\nRather than vainly strive to postpone their date of departure, those who hear the Lord of Death's decrees instead are charged to live honorable and meaningful lives, not necessarily long ones. One should greet death as a friend, and so he shall greet you in kind, and carry you to a long and quiet sleep, where the world's pains may trouble us no more."

 faith_corsair_adj:0 "Azrîyamanoi"
 faith_corsair_adherent:0 "Azrîyala"
 faith_corsair_adherent_plural:0 "Azrîyalai"
 faith_corsair_desc:0 "Among the superstitious sailors of the Umbarean cost, a cult of two great sea spirits exists, known as the Azrîyamanoi. Malíciam, the lord of the deep, is a harsh lord, capricious in his actions and his deeds. He acts seemingly at random, and can flip between being a dear friend and a deadly foe in an instant. His wife, Uyuninêz, lady of calm waters, is a restraining force on his tempers and wills, but is the weaker of the two. To her sailors cry and make burnt offerings, and among the corsairs it is custom to bear a shrine to both of the great spirits on every ship.\n\nArising from the Númenórean (and subsequent Black Númenórean and Dunedain) dominance of the region of Umbar and the natives that lived there, the worship of Malíciam and Uyuninêz is a corrupted fusion of the Haradrim fear of the sea god (Malíciam), and the Númenórean reverence for the Maiar of Ulmo, Osse and Uinen."

 faith_chelkar_desc:0 "The ancient faith of the Haradrim before the rise of Sauron's influence, it worshipped an entire pantheon of gods ruled over by Nâdi-manyê the Windlord. Sitting at the confluence of empires, it was highly tolerant and adaptive, absorbing many aspects from Númenor, Rhûn, and Khand. \n\nBy the later Third Age, this faith has become a persecuted minority by the ascendant faith of the Serpent-King, Khäz-gramaze."

Plots, schemes, and intrigue are the standard for those who uphold the spider-lord's rites in the shadowed corners of Harad. Even among those men that serve the darkness, there is a certain... unease, concerning those that follow the great spider.

In the grand cosmology of the Haradrim, he is barely mentioned, yet his cult has remained one of the most enduring in all of Far Harad. In truth, he is an ancient import of Sîrayn, but was adopted with gusto by the Haradrim living in the harsh, rocky lands of the southwest Dune Sea. In Sîrayn the cult has long declined to the point of disappearence, but in Harad it has endured, much like the stalwart goats he is master of, which the Aukuag and Qarsag rely upon for their livelihoods. Yet his traits of simple life, stout resilience, and kind hospitality to strangers has won him great admiration in the harsher lands of Harad."
