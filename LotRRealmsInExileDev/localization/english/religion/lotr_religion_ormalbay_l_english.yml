 faith_azianic_desc:0 "The worship of the sun-goddess Āzië established in ancient days by Ozmaran the Sage, the Āzianite faithful lift their praises to the sun, guardian and mother to mankind.\n\nĀzianites hold that the sun is the last source of untainted Light, where all human souls come from and must return to. But the physical world is marred by shadow, and this stain is upon even the soul - only those who master themselves and resist the sins of the world may take the path to the origin of all. Yet not all who do so forsake the world, but instead chose to remain, or return even, and be born anew, to guide others in the ways of righteousness. Until the day when darkness and despair are no more, and the light of the human heart outshines every shadow."
