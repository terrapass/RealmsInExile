 adunai_religion_desc:0 "The Adûnai are those descended from the Black Númenóreans and the King's Men, who came to reject the spiritual order as handed down to them by the Elves and Valar. Their faiths run a wide gambit of beliefs and practices, but a common thread is the blessed nature of Númenórean - Adûnaic - heritage."

 kings_men_desc:0 "The [kingsmen|E] began as a political faction within the [numenorean|E] Court, but they have long since evolved past that. The [numenoreans|E], desiring eternal life in their bliss, began to resent the [banofthevalar|E]. So too did they begin to resent the Eldar, whose eternal life they judged should be theirs as well by right of their forefather Azrubêl, Eärendil the Morningstar. They came to judge the [valargods|E] as withholding from them the choice of their Doom by malice, not lack of ability. In time this became a deepset belief that it was Mankind, not the [ainurgods|E] or the [quendi|E], that were the true heirs of the world, and that their time had now come. And amongst Men, the [numenoreans|E] were the purest, most worthy, and so they descended into hedonism and tyranny. \n\nEven to the end, when the worship of [melkorcharacter|E] and loyalty to the King became so deeply intertwined, there was still those that refused to acknowledge [morgothcharacter|E], holding him as merely another of the [ainurgods|E] seeking to dominate humanity. After the [akallabeth|E], these two hesitantly united factions violently clashed in the southern Númenórean colonies, each blaming the other for the Downfall."
 #Original Kings Men DESC: The King's Men were originally Númenóreans that shunned the ways of the Valar and actively went against their will in the search for immortality. Following the wrath of Eru and the sinking of Númenor, the survivors of the calamity continued to seek refuge in the worship of Melkor. Hatred and turmoil found root in the hearts of those "Black Númenóreans", who spread their doctrines of corruption and malice amongst the natives of southern Middle-earth.

 ### An-Balkûmagân ###

 faith_anballukhor_adj:0 "Batân an-Aphan"
 faith_anballukhor_adherent:0 "Aphanist"
 faith_anballukhor_adherent_plural:0 "Aphanists"
 faith_anballukhor_desc:0 "In the aftermath of the Fall of Númenor, many previous beliefs were shaken. From the chaos and turmoil of the early centuries of the Third Age arose a new doctrine in An-Balkûmagân, known as the Batân an-Aphan, or 'Path of Bliss'.\n\nEmphasizing the beauty and transient nature of the world, the Anbalûkkhôri embraced the pursuit of beauty, joy, and pleasure above all others - these, they held, are the supreme goods of this world, their moral worth self-evident. Those that seek ascetism in pursuit of righteousness harm themselves without need. All our fates are determined ere we are born, so why deny what providence grants us?\n\nIn the Aphanist view of the world, some are predestined for propserity, and these are the Adûnai. Granted greater years within the world, their days to savor prolonged, they have been given a divine mandate to seek ever-greater joys, more perfect beauties. However, the Aphanists do acknowledge those not of the Adûnai may attempt to walk the path, and if so, bid them luck in their search for bliss in this world."
