While Béma roams afar, his wife Foldewyn, mighty in her own right, reigns over the fey in her court of starlight. \n\nDwelling in the forest of the mist, the Leofring believe that Foldewyn bears a fickle mood, proud, and slow to forgive the mistakes of mankind. Her favor is perilous to acquire, though rich when gotten; for few come again from her forest, and not unchanged. Priestesses intercede with her fey on mankind's behalf, hoping to earn her favor and not her ire. If her ire is raised, men have been said to walk into the mist, enchanted, never to be seen again."
