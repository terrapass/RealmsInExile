 religion_group_eruhini_desc:0 ""When we name you "Children of Eru" we do not speak lightly. We proclaim that you are our kin, in a kinship far closer than that which binds together all other creatures of Arda, and ourselves to them."\n\nThe Children of Ilúvatar, also Híni Ilúvataro or Eruhíni, are the two races of Elves and Men. Their existence, along with the Universe in which they were to live, was conceived in the Music of the Ainur, but the Ainur had no part in their making. Ilúvatar alone brought them into being, and they had fëar (spirits) of the same type as the Ainur, though far less powerful."

 faith_numenorean_adherent:0 "Eruhín"
 faith_numenorean_adherent_plural:0 "Eruhíni"
 faith_numenorean_desc:0 "Tutored by the Eldar and the Maiar, the Númenóreans adopted their religious customs as their own. Just as Manwë upon Taniquentil, the King of the Númenóreans would thrice a year ascend the holy mountain, the Meneltarma, at times of sowing, midsummer, and harvest, offering the fruits of the earth to the Allfather. These were the Neldë Kyermi (the Three Prayers), the Erukyermë, Erulaitalë, and Eruhantalë. In addition to their reverence of the One, the Númenóreans also revered the Valar as his appointed stewards and regents of Eä. \n\nOne unique aspect of the Númenórean faith compared with the High-Elves and Valar is the 'Old Hope of Men', the Estel Enwina, a legend preserved since before the Edain entered Beleriand. According to the lore their ancestors had passed down to them, the Hope was that one day the Allfather would enter creation incarnated as one of the Eruhín and mend the marring from beginning to end. \n\n#TOLKIENQUOTE "Ilúvatar is the Lord for Always who dwells beyond the world, who made it and is not of it nor in it, but loves it." \n\n#QUOTEDCHARACTER - Rúmil of Tirion, The Book of Lost Tales Part One, "The Music of the Ainur""

 faith_edain_desc:0 ""Et Eärello Endorenna utúlien sinomë maruvan ar Hildinyar tenn’ Ambar-metta."\n\n"Out of the Great Sea to Middle-earth I am come. Here I will abide, and my heirs, unto the ending of the world."\n\nThus did Elendil speak upon his landfall in Middle-earth after the [akallabeth|E], and so were the Kingdoms of [gondor|E] and [arnor|E] borne from his nine ships and the colonies of the [faithfulshort|E]. In those realms alone were preserved the ancient rites and worship of [numenor|E] of old, though the Great Prayers are said no longer. The reverence of [eru|E] himself is the centre of the spiritual life of the [dunedain|E], but they do not worship through great temples and ostentatious displays - rather, the [dunedain|E] prioritize private contemplation of the One. \n\nIn daily life, the [valargods|E] are the ones invoked and called upon to intercede on behalf of the Faithful, and of them [ulmocharacter|E] is the most cherished." 
 #Old Edain desc: The Edain was the name given by the Elves to the noble Men of the First Age who fought alongside with the Elves in the Wars of Beleriand.\n\nEdain is normally the Sindarin word for Men (sing. adan "Man") and thus applied to all Men, though it became associated with only those who came into Beleriand during the Long Peace, the noble Three Houses who became close allies with the Elves and fought beside them against Morgoth. Other groups of Men who stayed in Eriador or the East; or entered Beleriand later in the First Age, such as the Easterlings, are not counted among the Edain."

 faith_edain_ulmo_adherent_plural:0 "Adherents of Ulmo"
 faith_edain_ulmo_desc:0 "The 'Covenant of Ulmo' refers to the old concord between the Vala [ulmocharacter|E] and the men of [numenor|E]. As an island nation, and eventual maritime power, [ulmocharacter|E] was amongst the most revered of the [valargods|E] in [numenor|E]. In turn, on account of both their reverence and their long friendship with the Eldar, Ulmo came to love the [numenoreans|E] and alone of the Powers spoke to them directly, particularly those belonging to the Guild of Venturers. Also known as the Uinendili, this guild's exploration of the seas and lands was at once worship and adventure in the name of the Sea-King and his [maiargods|E]. \n\nEven though [numenor|E] the Blessed has been long drowned beneath the Great Sea, the old covenant is remembered still in the lands of the Exiles. Dúnedain mariners in Pelargir, Tharagrondost, Dol Amroth, and other great seaports continue to try to keep the ancient traditions of the Guild of Venturers alive."

 faith_edain_manwe_desc:0 "Amongst the Dúnedain, the [elderkingcharacter|E]'s followers are the most zealous supporters of Elendil and his heirs. For, they judge, only under a truly righteous king can Mankind, and indeed all the world, know true stability and prosperity. All the great tragedies of the years past - the [downfallofnumenor|E], the Gondorian [kinstrife|E], the divide and fall of [arnorrealm|E] - they can all be tracked back to leaders weak in moral fibre and their inability to live up to the Elder King's example as a just and wise ruler. \n\nHumanity must replicate the divine order, as decreed by Eru Ilúvatar himself - did not he make Manwë Sulimo the Viceregent of Eä, and Manwë in turn appointed the line of Elendil to rule the Faithful?"

 faith_edain_varda_desc:0 "It is said that in [gondor|E] there are more speakers of Sindarin and loremasters of Quenya than still live in all the Elven realms east of the Sea. In the aftermath of the [akallabeth|E], some members of the Faithful went even farther in their alignment to the Elves, even adopting Elvish religious habits, rejecting any 'mannish' influences which they deemed to have infected that primordial truth. While such zealots are few and far between these days, the Elendili, or 'the Elf-friends', still maintain a more elvish style of faith, obvious in their preference for Sindarin and Quenya, as well as their special veneration of [vardacharacter|E] above all the other Valar."
