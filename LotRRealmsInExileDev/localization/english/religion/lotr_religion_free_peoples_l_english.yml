From him were born the Ainur, and the Ainur by the conduction of Ilúvatar wrought a great song. But Melkor, mightiest of the Ainur sought to make the song his own and usurp Ilúvatar and so discord entered it, the root of all the worlds ills. At last, when they were finished, Ilúvatar showed the Ainur a vision of what their song had made, before speaking one word - Eä - be. And so, the world was. \n\nSome of the Ainur decided to descend into Arda and dwell therein, and the mightiest of these were the Valar. But in time, out of pride and jealousy Melkor too followed, and war was made between the powers ere the Children awoke. At long last, the labours of the Ainur completed, the Children of Ilúvatar awoke to a world broken from what it was, but ready for their habitation."

However, they still maintain their own distinct traditions, such as a greater tendency to perform rites and ceremonies of passage - a hunt might be dedicated to Oromë or a harvest to Yavanna, on a more formal, ritualistic level than the informal invocations and thanks offered by the Calaquendi."

While they have little knowledge of the Powers, they are not unaware of the truth of the One, and worship Him in their own way. They sing and write of the light of the stars or the sound of falling water, the sweetness of fruit or the luminescence of gems from deep within the earth. With music and dance most of all they rejoice in the magnificence of Eä. \n\nIf they have not the high lore of the Eldar of the Uttermost West, and their prayers are not spoken to the Powers, the One surely cannot find fault in the pure spirit of their worship."

 faith_path_of_wisdom_desc:0 "The Batân an-Izindi, Adunaic for 'The Path of Wisdom', is a religion of revelation begun by Imrathôr of Narîk-zadan, known to history as Izindubêth the Prophet. The faith emphasizes the supremacy of [eruiluvatar|E] above all living things, even the [valargods|E]. The Kolir (Ainur) should be invoked and remembered, but their place of subordination to the One remembered, so that one does not, in their fervor for the Kolir, supplant the One who made them. \n\nIzindubêth is said to have received his revelations on the great mountain Urud an-Khibil, after five days of contemplation. Izindubêth in his revelation percieved that Ilúvatar's proper place and reverence was slowly being worn away by the Haradrim traditions Kâthasaptha sought to integrate. Thus he sought to return to a more pure and contemplation centered way of faith, and so the Batan an-Izindi was born. Izindubêth was given leave to preach throughout all of Bellakar, and many hearkened to his message. \n\nTo this day it has maintained its simple but powerful faith, striving not to enforce Eru's word by the sword but by diligent evangelism, and in friendship with the Kings of Bellakar and the Kâthasaptha. However, when the darkness or the profane dare to encroach upon the sacred lands of the faithful, the Army of the Righteous has arisen to fight in the name of the Allfather. \n\n#TOLKIENQUOTE "The One whom the Adûnâi name Êru, whom the Tumakveh deem Infinite in Wisdom—this One has sent me to make known the Batân an-Izindi, the Path of Truth, to those who will listen."#! \n\n#QUOTEDCHARACTER - Imrathôr Izindubêth upon descending from the Urud an-Khibil" #Matt note: its either “religion of revelation” or “revolutionary religion”.

 faith_infinite_wisdom_desc:0 "Kâthasaptha, or 'Infinite Wisdom', refers to the syncretic faith founded by [zimrebal|E], first king of [bellakar|E]. [zimrebal|E] desired to unify his kingdom by bridging its two largest religious groups, the Númenórean Eruists and the native faiths of the Bellanarod. To achieve this, he identified the Haradrim Tarkarûn-i-Mâsra (the ancient sky-god) with Eru, and the other pantheon members with the Valar or Maiar. In particular he claimed the moon goddess Ladnoca, which the Númenóreans equated to Varda, had been the one to give him this charge and the source of his divine mandate. He integrated the Númenórean and Bellanarod religious calendars and created a new fane in the style of Meneltarma upon Izindutârik, where the kings of Bellakar could offer prayers in the name of the Faithful to the [erutheone|E]. \n\nThis syncretism did not satisfy either side of the kingdom fully, with the more zealous Faithful claiming that the faith had been tainted by 'Southron Blasphemies' and the Haradrim unsatisfied by the re-elevation of an ancient, all-but-forgotten god to the same level as the goddess Ladnóca, patroness of mankind. However, this syncretism has with time become accepted and embraced by a large majority of Bellakar, though traditional Haradrim cults and Númenórean worship still persist alongside it."

 faith_conservative_eruism_desc:0 "While much of the Bellakari have embraced either the ways of Kâthasaptha or the revelations of Izindubêth in their worship of the One, there remains those who defiantly cling to what they view as a pure, unmingled Númenórean faith tradition, untinted with the Haradric blashphemies their kin have adopted. \n\nIn the absence of the line of Elros and the Meneltarma upon which to offer words to the One, the adherents of Êru-bên have come to the theology that ever man bears the right to call upon and account himself before the One. The Tumakveh may be able to speak for the Faithful of Bellakar as a body and present prayers upon Izindutârik, but each member of the faithful has that right as well."
