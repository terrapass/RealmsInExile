 religion_edain_desc:0 "Et Eärello Endorenna utúlien sinomë maruvan ar Hildinyar tenn’ Ambar-metta. \n\nOut of the Great Sea to Middle-earth I am come. Here I will abide, and my heirs, unto the ending of the world. \n\nThus did Elendil speak upon his landfall in Middle-earth after the Akallabêth, and so were the Kingdoms of Gondor and Arnor borne from his seven ships and the colonies of the Faithful. In those realms alone were preserved the ancient rites and worship of Numenor of old, though the Great Prayers are said no longer. The worship of Eru himself is the center of the spiritual life of the Dúnedain, but they do not worship through great temples and ostentatious displays - rather, the Dúnedain prioritize private contemplation and words of supplication to the One. They remember and honour the Ainur, and invoke them, but they view Eru alone as their true and final patron." 
 #Old Edain desc: The Edain was the name given by the Elves to the noble Men of the First Age who fought alongside with the Elves in the Wars of Beleriand.\n\nEdain is normally the Sindarin word for Men (sing. adan "Man") and thus applied to all Men, though it became associated with only those who came into Beleriand during the Long Peace, the noble Three Houses who became close allies with the Elves and fought beside them against Morgoth. Other groups of Men who stayed in Eriador or the East; or entered Beleriand later in the First Age, such as the Easterlings, are not counted among the Edain."

 religion_edain_ulmo_desc:0 "The 'Covenant of Ulmo' refers to the old concord between the Vala Ulmo and the men of Númenor. As an island nation, and eventual maritime power, Ulmo was amongst the most revered of the Valar in Númenor. In turn, on account of both their reverence and their long friendship with the Eldar, Ulmo came to love the Númenóreans and alone of the Powers spoke to them directly, particularly those belonging to the Guild of Venturers. Also known as the Uinendili, this guild's exploration of the seas and lands was at once worship and adventure in the name of the Sea-King and his maiar. \n\nEven though Númenor the Blessed has been long drowned beneath the Great Sea, the old covenant is remembered still in the lands of the Exiles. Dúnedain mariners in Pelargir, Tharagrondost, Dol Amroth, and other great seaports continue to try to keep the ancient traditions of the Guild of Venturers alive."

For, they judge, only under a truly righteous king can Mankind, and indeed all the world, know true stability and prosperity. All the great tragedies of the years past - the downfall of Númenor, the Gondorian Kin-Strife, the divide and fall of Arnor - they can all be tracked back to leaders weak in moral fibre and their inability to live up to the Elder King's example as a just and wise ruler. \n\nHumanity must replicate the divine order, as decreed by Eru Ilúvatar himself - did not he make Manwë Sulimo the Viceregent of Eä, and Manwë in turn appointed the line of Elendil to rule the Faithful?"

 religion_edain_varda_desc:0 "It is said that in Gondor there are more speakers of Sindarin and loremasters of Quenya than still live in all the Elven realms east of the Sea. In the aftermath of the Akallabêth, some members of the Faithful went even farther in their alignment to the Elves, even adopting Elvish religious habits, rejecting any 'mannish' influences which they deemed to have infected that primordial truth. While such zealots are few and far between these days, the Elendili, or 'the Elf-friends', still maintain a more elvish style of faith, obvious in their preference for Sindarin and Quenya, as well as their special veneration of Varda above all the other Valar."

 religion_path_of_wisdom_desc:0 "The Batan an-Izindi, Adunaic for 'The Straight Road', is a revelationatory religion begun by Izindubeth, whose name has been lost to history. A splinter branch of Kâthasaptha in Northern Bellakar, it sought to return the ancient faith of Numenor to its traditional morality and purity. \n\nIzindubeth is said to have received his revelations on the great mountain Urud an-Khibil after five days of meditation, hearing the voice of the One, who bid him to chastise his wayward children and guide them back to the true faith. Batan an-Izindi places extreme emphasis on the primacy of Eru alone as the true God, stressing that the Valar are his intermediaries, not Gods. This fairly militant view contrasts with Kâthasaptha, whose more tolerant and pluralistic absorption of the native Haradrim dieties is believed to have been the root origin of the split."

 religion_infinite_wisdom_adherent_plural:0 "Izindithôni"
 religion_infinite_wisdom_desc:0 "Kâthasaptha, or 'Infinite Wisdom', refers to the syncretic faith founded by Zimrêbal, first king of Bellakar. Zimrêbal desired to unify his kingdom by bridging its two largest religious groups, the Númenórean Eruists and the native faiths of the Bellanarod. To achieve this, he identified the Haradrim Tarkarûn-i-Mâsra (the ancient sky-god) with Eru, and the other pantheon members with the Valar or Maiar. He integrated the Númenórean and Bellanarod religious calendars, and created a new fane in the style of Meneltarma upon Izindutârik, where the kings of Bellakar and later Bellazan could offer prayers in the name of the Faithful to the One. \n\nThis syncretism did not satisfy either side of the kingdom fully, with the more zealous Faithful claiming that the faith had been tainted by 'Southron Blasphemies' and the Haradrim unsatisfied by the re-elevation of an ancient, all-but-forgotten god over the goddess Ladnóca. However, this syncretism has with time become accepted and embraced by a large majority of Bellazan, though traditional Haradrim cults and Númenórean worship still persist alongside it."

It translates to 'Annointed Dwelling', the world of Arda, which the Ainur made in the Great Song under the conduction of Eru Ilúvatar."
