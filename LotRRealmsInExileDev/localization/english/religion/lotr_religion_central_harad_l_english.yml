 faith_sanbaiz_desc:0 "The ancient Spider-God, Sanbaiz is patron of thieves, apostates, traitors, and murderers.

Even among those men that serve the darkness, there is a certain... unease, concerning those that follow the great spider. They know little shame, freely flaunting their plots, delighting in the great game of wits. They embrace life with a lighthearted facetiousness that borders on mockery, living by a creed of 'if you can get away with it, do it'."

 faith_garauda_desc:0 "Long a source of bafflement for foreign scholars, Garauda is the lord of goats. In the grand cosmology of the Haradrim, he is barely mentioned, yet his cult has remained one of the most enduring in all of Far Harad. In truth, he is an ancient import of Sîrayn, but was adopted with gusto by the Haradrim living in the harsh, rocky lands of the southwest Dune Sea. In Sîrayn the cult has long declined to the point of disappearence, but in Harad it has endured, much like the stalwart goats he is master of, which the Aukuag and Qarsag rely upon for their livelihoods. Yet his traits of simple life, stout resilience, and kind hospitality to strangers has won him great admiration in the harsher lands of Harad."
