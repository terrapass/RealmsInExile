 forodwaith_religion_desc:0 "The everfrozen lands of Forodwaith has developed many different belief systems, often relating to the spirits of the land around them."
 # The people of Forochel place a pre-eminence on cosmic balance, and all things animate and inanimate have their own tarmo (or spirit), the force which binds a thing to its physical form.\n\nThey believe the physical world is but a smaller part of the greater Spirit World, Henkimaailma, which in turn is encompassed by Ympyrä. They are respectful to the spirits, but do not hold them in a strict heirarchy. Each spirit, of lesser or greater might, has its own place and purpose, just as anything else in the world does.

Some things, such as orcs, trolls, dragons and other unnatural creatures are held to be Ulkopuolesta, 'from outside'. Such creatures are held to originate from outside the natural order, and as such, should be excised from it wherever possible."

Rejoice in the honest displays of human nature found in conflict, the comradery found in battle. Through this the true nature of humanity is revealed."
