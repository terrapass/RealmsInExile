In Donan belief, there are two Great Bels (spirits) that take primacy - Kôbah and Kaz, alongside other lesser spirits.\n\nKôbah, known as the Old God of the Mountain, is the elder, lord over the earth, and teacher of mankind in the arts of craft. Kaz is the lord of the open sky, and it was his winds that whispered the first words into the ears of mankind, and so was speech born. Even to this day, it is believed children are born who possesses a tenuous connection to these ancient, mighty spirits. These blessed spirit-borns are able to hear the ancient tutelage of Kôbah rumble through the earth, and to beseech the winds to speak to kindly Kaz on their people's behalf."
