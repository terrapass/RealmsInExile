The Orcs wage war as often upon each other as those outside of it, plundering and backstabbing their own as freely as those of other races. While brutal and cunning in equal measure, the orcs are also irrational, short-sighted, and greedy. It is rare to see the orcs unite for any sort of greater purpose, and if they do, it is only ever for a short while."
