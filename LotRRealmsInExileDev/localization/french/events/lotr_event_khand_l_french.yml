The meritocratic tradition of the Variag means that only the bravest warriors, who have proven their honor and gained recognition, have the necessary support to rule the various factions of Khand.\n\nAs a battle-hardened Variag warrior, you understand that in a Middle-earth at war, any day could be your last. It is time for your heir to begin the path of public recognition, and to continue your legacy. To do so, your heir must face the leaders of the different factions of Khand in challenges that will measure his capacity and validity as a future ruler."
