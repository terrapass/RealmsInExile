 anduin_vale.0100.t:0 "Les Beornings"
 anduin_vale.0100.desc:0 "Dans les retombées de la bataille des Cinq Armées, le mystérieux changeur de peau Beorn accepta avec réticence d'endosser la seigneurie sur plusieurs tribus du Val d'Anduin et de l'ouest de Grand'Peur, taking to wife Medulynn, the daughter of the chieftain of the Olphanging tribe. \n\nHis son Grimbeorn, of like mind and stature to his father, now rules over a wide realm between the mountains and the deep forest. The 'Beornings', as they are known, keep open the High Pass, the Ford of Carrock, and the western stretches of the Old Forest Road (or 'Viduweg', as the woodmen name it), keeping the mountain goblins at bay. \n\nYet to the south, an evil has returned to the cursed fortress of Dol Guldur. And to the north, rumours come of renewed raids by the goblins of Gundabad. In these darkening days, will the Beornings keep the fractious tribes united and resist the machinations of their foes? Or will they be swept aside before the rising tide, like so many of the petty realms that preceded them, with the legacy of Beorn forgotten forever?"
 anduin_vale.0100.a:0 "United, the wood and vale will stand!"
 anduin_vale.0100.a.tt:0 "A true bear cannot rest at ease"

 anduin_vale.0102.t:0 "The Realm of the All-Thane"
 anduin_vale.0102.desc:0 "For time out of mind, the Woodmen and their brethren in the Vale have remained fiercely independent, both from outsiders and from each other. Only in the direst of need have the fractious tribes elected a single ruler, the All-Thane or 'Aledegan', to unite their efforts against a common enemy. \n\nBut times have changed. Under your dynasty a great realm has been forged, uniting both the Anduin Vale and the traditional lands of the Woodmen in the great forest of Greenwood. The disparate folk of Wood and Vale have all acknowledged your leadership, and the right of your heirs to rule in perpetuity. Never again will your people be divided, to fall prey to predatory orcs, wargs and worse. You have created the Realm of the All-Thane - the Aladagana!"
 anduin_vale.0102.a:0 "And I am the Aladegan!"
 anduin_vale.0102.a.tt:0 "You have created the empire title of Aladegana"
