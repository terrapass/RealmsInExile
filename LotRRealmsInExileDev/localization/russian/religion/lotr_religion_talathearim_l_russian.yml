 faith_easterling_war_desc:0 "Maladûm, the ancient war-god of the Easterlings, Forefather of Dragons, champions strength, and the valor won through honorable conquest. The war god is harsh but fair in his dealings; all who live and die by the sword are in his hands and authority. It is said that worthy warriors are called to his halls, set apart from the other gods, where they might train, feast, and gird themselves for the day when the Final Battle comes. On that day, the right to rule shall be proven to derive foremost from strength. \n\nAnother indigenous faith that Sauron has manipulated to his own use, the cult of Maladûm is most commonly found among the Tedjin and the Balcoth."

 faith_easterling_shadow_desc:0 "Kôr-Sharhaigûn is the ancient god of darkness, death, and fate among the Easterlings. He is, of all the gods, the most dangerous - bemused by the bickering of his kin for the celestial throne, as he alone of them all knows the truth. In time, they all shall come before him, and pass into his darkness, the world returning to the void from which is came. \n\nUntil then, he alternates delightfully between moods, fickle in his fey tempers. Sometimes he is wise and kindly, offering advice and wisdom to the worthy, foretelling what is to come. Othertimes he is cruel and vain; this world, ephemeral and passing, is a plaything to him, and the suffering of mankind creates the sweetest odes."

 nurniag_adherent_plural:0 "Overseers"
 nurniag_desc:0 "Encircling the Sea of Núrn on three sides, the Núrniags form an upper caste within Mordor. They gorge on the conquests of Sauron, which provides them the slaves needed to work their vast plantation. If the Dark Lord is not waging war, it is not uncommon to find young and adventurous Núrniag aristocrats leading slaving parties, aiming to secure wealth and fame for themselves. \n\nReligiously, the Núrniag are one of the most religiously orthodox groups of Sauron's empire, worshipping him through a local variant of the Cult of the Lidless Eye. They revere him as both King and God, and credit him with the fertility of Núrn's black soil. They offer him lavish tribute from their vast plantations, extracted from the bloodied corpses of their legions of slaves."
