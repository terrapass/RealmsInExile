 palantir.0101.t:0 "Палантир"
 palantir.0101.desc:0 "Одними из самых желанных артефактов дунэдайн являются Палантиры. В давние времена их создал на западе Феанор. Эльдар Тол Эрессеа подарили семь Видящих Камней Амандилю из Андуниэ, чтобы утешить Верных, когда тень упала на Нуменор. И хотя камни были доставлены в Средиземье ещё Элендилем и его сыновьями, никто не использовал Видящие Камни с тех времён, когда Минас Итиль был захвачен Королём-чародеем. Мудрецы Гондора решили, что это было бы слишком опасно. Само их существование долгое время скрывалось Правящими Наместниками. Они боялись, что стоит врагу узнать об их мощи, он бросит все силы, чтобы заполучить их.\n\nПалантиры — инструмент для предвидения, они позволяют своему обладателю видеть невидимое, наблюдать за далёкими землями, общаться с другими видящими камнями. В нынешние времена инструмент этот довольно опасен. Для того, чтобы подчинить Палантир своей воле требуется недюжинная воля. И даже в этом случае неясно кто окажется на другом конце и что он попытается сделать в ответ. Но если силы и разум крепки, то Палантир может послужить мощнейшим оружием. Взгляд в Видящий Камень может раскрыть секреты вселенной, показать планы врага и рассказать о его стратегии.\n\nСтоит ли мне использовать Палантир в стремлении стать сильнее и мудрее, или же это слишком опасно?" 
 palantir.0101.a:0 "Такое оружие — настоящее благословение, которое нельзя не использовать против врага."
 palantir.0101.a.tt:0 "Вы используете Палантир."
 palantir.0101.b:0 "Это слишком опасно..."
 palantir.0101.b.tt:0 "Вы решаете не использовать Палантир."
 
 palantir.0102.t:0 "The Wilds of Ithilien"
 palantir.0102.desc:0 "Pulled forward into the haze of the Palantír, you fly amongst the woodland and over the River Anduin, seeing all that wander and gather in the boundless forest. You perceive rangers on scouting missions, you gaze upon a tribe of roving Uruks, and as your foresight moves southward you begin to understand the design of an enemy incursion. They are many and speak in a tongue most unkind, but their objective becomes clear to you: they mean to raid and rob the Ithilien roads, harassing the supply lines destined for the outer defence of the realm. \n\nYou send word of this to your castellan, who in turn sends a rider eastward to warn the Rangers of Ithilien. Through your foresight, a great debacle has been averted."
 palantir.0102.a:0 "The enemy uses clever tactics, and so must we."
 palantir.0102.a.tt:0 "You gaze into the Palantír again."
 palantir.0102.b:0 "That is all the information I require."
 palantir.0102.b.tt:0 "You cease looking into the Palantír."
 
 palantir.0103.t:0 "The Plains of Harondor"
 palantir.0103.desc:0 "The winds shift, and in turn so does your gaze, moving south into the open plains of Harondor. Unlike Ithilien, these lands are rife with open turmoil. Battles are engaged in the open fields, horses and men scream, and a flurry of arrows cut down a battalion of Haradrim warriors before your very eyes. \n\nButchery, such terrible, unwarranted butchery. Long ago these lands were calm, and only the wind would disturb its inhabitants; but now the black tide of war encompasses all things living, and all one can do is hope for better times to come."
 palantir.0103.a:0 "There is peril here, as well as opportunity."
 palantir.0103.a.tt:0 "You gaze into the Palantír again."
 palantir.0103.b:0 "That is all the information I require."
 palantir.0103.b.tt:0 "You cease looking into the Palantír."
 
 palantir.0104.t:0 "The City of Pelargir"
 palantir.0104.desc:0 "Moving westward, the Anduin comes into view again, and with it the great city of Pelargir, home of the Sealords. Great vessels from along the coasts of Gondor lay at anchor as mariners and guildsmen converse, spreading news of the happenings of places far-away. You hear a few of these conversations in detail, and the closer you come to the Palace of the Sealord, the more damning each story becomes. \n\nPolitics, secrets of every kind, nothing is secret when laid bare before your encompassing eye. No scandal is safe, and after a few hours of listening, you understand the political machinations of the city more than anyone else."
 palantir.0104.a:0 "Even in the palace of the Sealord, nothing is secret."
 palantir.0104.a.tt:0 "You gaze into the Palantír again."
 palantir.0104.b:0 "That is all the information I require."
 palantir.0104.b.tt:0 "You cease looking into the Palantír."
 
 palantir.0105.t:0 "The Deserts of Harad"
 palantir.0105.desc:0 "Free from the shadowed corridors of the Sealord's Palace, the luscious lands of Gondor are replaced by the dry deserts of foreign Harad. Caravans move along common footpaths. Half of these traders move southward to pay tribute to the Golden King, whilst half move northward to deliver tribute to the Dark Lord himself. \n\nAs you move ever-closer to the capital of the desert kingdom, things become clearer to you. Their soldiers are mustering; and even scores of Great Mûmakil gather in boundless war camps for a future offensive. Where they are going, however, remains a mystery even to you."
 palantir.0105.a:0 "They are ruled by the mystical Golden King..."
 palantir.0105.a.tt:0 "You gaze into the Palantír again."
 palantir.0105.b:0 "That is all the information I require."
 palantir.0105.b.tt:0 "You cease looking into the Palantír."
 
 palantir.0106.t:0 "The Dark Tower"
 palantir.0106.desc:0 "Sudden, sharp, all becomes silent. The dunes are replaced by an endless void of blackness. Featureless and quiet, you think of perhaps letting go of the Palantír, but before you can, you are suddenly pulled northward. Over the mountains and fertile land of Nurn, pulled without delay towards a tower in the distance. \n\nHe sees you! Sauron sees you! He appears in the form of a great eye, lidless, wreathed in flame. Your hand begins to burn, and in the ancient, foul tongue of Melkor the Dark Lord begins to voice his commands. \n\nBut you are not weak, and you will certainly be not made a slave of malice. You steel yourself, and in a moment of immense clarity you break your bond with the Dark Lord. \n\nAll is quiet, again..."
 palantir.0106.a:0 "I will never be made a slave of the Dark Lord!"
 palantir.0106.a.tt:0 "You gaze into the Palantír again."
 palantir.0106.b:0 "Against such power there can be no victory..."
 palantir.0106.b.tt:0 "You cease looking into the Palantír."
 
 palantir.0107.t:0 "The Withered Tree"
 palantir.0107.desc:0 "Free from the shackles of Sauron's own Palantír, your gaze returns to Minas Tirith itself, espying the citizens of the Tower of Guard as they go about their daily lives. Level by level, street by street, you climb, eventually arriving at the fountain of the Great Courtyard of Kings. \n\nEven now, with such peril at hand, the Fountain Guard stand vigilant, their winged helms glistening against the magnificent radiance of the sun. They guard the withered White Tree, and in this moment you feel a profound grief, knowing that what glory once was, is no more..."
 palantir.0107.a:0 "I must find hope!"
 palantir.0107.a.tt:0 "You gaze into the Palantír again."
 palantir.0107.b:0 "Gondor's rule is weakening..."
 palantir.0107.b.tt:0 "You cease looking into the Palantír."
 
 palantir.0108.t:0 "The Horselords"
 palantir.0108.desc:0 "Sullen and downtrodden, the Palantír once again comes alive with light, bidding your foresight look northward into the realm of Rohan. Great hosts of horsemen gather, spears raised and ready for war. Just as the Haradrim were, they are planning something, plotting and preparing for a design you have yet to comprehend. \n\nAt the very least you are able to see these things, and now known, you can make ready for whatever threat may come."
 palantir.0108.a:0 "Even now they plot my demise!"
 palantir.0108.a.tt:0 "You gaze into the Palantír again."
 palantir.0108.b:0 "What terrible wickedness. I must stop..."
 palantir.0108.b.tt:0 "You cease looking into the Palantír."
 
 palantir.0109.t:0 "The Easterlings of Rhûn"
 palantir.0109.desc:0 "One last time, your gaze is pulled by force, going eastward pass even the dominion of Mordor. There, in the land of Rhûn, you see ancient cities of wonderous splendour bustling with life and activity. \n\nBut as your gaze focuses, it becomes clear that this form of life is corrupted in nature. The Easterlings are still counted amongst the ranks of the enemy, and even now you perceive that they plot your destruction. Hordes of men, horses, and even chariots lumber out the city gates, moving west towards the rising sun."
 palantir.0109.a:0 "Their legions grow with each passing day..."
 palantir.0109.a.tt:0 "You gaze into the Palantír again."
 palantir.0109.b:0 "Is there no end to the influence of Sauron?"
 palantir.0109.b.tt:0 "You cease looking into the Palantír."
 
 palantir.0110.t:0 "A Shadowed Threat"
 palantir.0110.desc:0 "At last, the ordeal is through, but as your hand moves away from the seeing-stone you feel a great weight fall upon your body, nearly forcing you to your knees. \n\nSo much has become apparent, so many threats finally revealed. No doubt this knowledge will prove useful in the years to come..."
 palantir.0110.a:0 "I need rest..."
 
 palantir.0111.t:0 "The Minas-Anor Stone"
 palantir.0111.desc:0 "Amongst the coveted artifacts hidden within Minas Tirith is the Palantír of Minas Anor. Wrought in the ancient west by Fëanor, the seven seeing-stones were gifted to Amandil of Andúnië by the Eldar of Tol Eressëa, as comfort to the Faithful as the Shadow fell upon Númenor. Brought to Middle-earth by Anárion, the Anor-stone has not been used since the fall of Minas Ithil to the Witch-King, for the Wise of Gondor deemed the danger too great. Its very existence has, for centuries, been a secret of the Ruling Stewards, who feared that should its location be revealed, the enemy shall seek to steal its power. \n\nThe Palantíri are tools of farsight, allowing its bearer to perceive things unseen, in far-away lands, and to communicate with the other seeing-stones. They are dangerous tools in this age, for it takes great will to master a Palantír and bend it to one’s purpose — and even then, you do not know who else might bear another and attempt to so strike you in return. But with great strength of mind and spirit, a Palantír could be a weapon unmatched. Gazing into the Anor Stone might unveil secrets most important, revealing the plans of the enemy and granting insight into their strategies. \n\nShould I then use the Palantír to grow my own strength and wisdom, or is the danger simply too great?"
 palantir.0111.a:0 "Gaze into the Palantír."
 palantir.0111.b:0 "It is too dangerous..."
