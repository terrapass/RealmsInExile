 ### ROHAN KING EVENTS ###
 rohan.0001.t:0 "Король в Золотом чертоге"
 rohan.0001.desc:0 "[theoden.GetTitledFirstName] сын Тенгеля, восьмой король Второй линии, семнадцатый король Дома Эорла, признаётся и почитается своим народом. Рождённый в [GetTitleByKey('e_gondor_steward').GetNameNoTier], он вернулся в [GetTitleByKey('k_rohan').GetNameNoTier|l] вместе со своим отцом, когда умер его дед [fengel.GetFirstName]. Он рос, окруженный людьми, что говорят на вестроне, а также выучил синдарин. При Теодене Медусельд стал оплотом стабильности и благородства эорлингов.\n\nНо кое-что омрачает длинное и мирное правление Теодена. У него есть лишь один ребёнок – любимый сын и наследник, [theodred.GetFirstName]. Пусть он уже мужчина в расцвете сил, благородный и храбрый в равной мере, Теоден не слепец, и понимает какие проблемы это может доставить королевству. Успокаивает его лишь то, что если суждено свершиться самому страшному, дети его возлюбленной сестры [theodwyn.GetFirstName] смогут унаследовать трон Рохана.\n\nИ пусть Риддермарк наслаждается временем мира и процветания, доносится тревожный ветер, приносящий отголоски далёкой войны, в которой Гондору угрожают на востоке. Быть может и в самом Рохане есть место внутренним дрязгам. Тени сгущаются, а возраст Теодена даёт о себе знать. Сможет ли он выстоять или падёт пред лицом неизбежной старости и отчаяния?"
 rohan.0001.a:0 "Вперёд, и не страшитесь тьмы!"

 rohan.1100.t:0 "Король в Золотом чертоге"
 rohan.1100.desc:0 "Когда перед вами отворяются тяжелые двери Медусельда, вас приветствует колючий ветер. Флаги с вашим гербом развеваются на прохладном утреннем бризе, а на выдохе вы выпускаете облачка белого пара. Рассвет озаряет каёмку Белых гор ярким пламенем, отбрасывающим длинные тени горных пиков на равнины Харроудейла. Длинная серебряная нить Снежницы тускло блестит в степи, едва задетая восходящим в столь ранний час солнцем. Рядом появляется один из членов совета, чтобы поприветствовать вас. «Милорд, народ без устали трудится, но стоит им завидеть своего короля, они обретут второе дыхание. Не соблаговолите ли вы явиться перед своим народом?»"
 rohan.1100.a:0 "«Я отправлюсь с патрулём до Энтовой Купели»."
 rohan.1100.b:0 "«Я загляну в стойла»."
 rohan.1100.c:0 "«Я понаблюдаю за обучением новых рекрутов»."
 rohan.1100.d:0 "«Уж лучше мне позаниматься делами государства»."
 
 rohan.1101.t:0 "Энтова Купель"
 rohan.1101.desc:0 "Ваши доспехи бликуют на солнце, когда вы едете с патрулём, состоящим из ветеранов: сияющая колонна, скачущая по морю трав. В стуке копыт ваших коней вам слышится славная история вашего народа и вашей земли. Вам вспоминается Эорл Юный и Брего. Вы выбираетесь в авангард своего отряда и скачете через холмы. Силуэты ваших всадников струятся по золотым полям вашей родины как река. Ваш горделивый восторг, однако, быстро прерывается! Пересекая гребень, ваш скакун оступается и начинает падать! Вы..."
 rohan.1101.a:0 "Пытаетесь соскочить с падающей лошади и приземлиться на ноги."
 rohan.1101.b:0 "Отклоняетесь назад, пытаясь выровнять скакуна."
 rohan.1101.c:0 "Отдаёте себя в руки судьбы и пытаетесь упасть, не растеряв достоинства."
 
 rohan.1102.t:0 "Конюшни Эдораса"
 rohan.1102.desc:0 "Вы спускаетесь по искусно выдолбленным ступеням Эдораса и, минуя шумную толпу, направляетесь к конюшням у врат. Стук молота по металлу и лязг подков слышны задолго до того, как сами строения попадают в поле зрения. Именно здесь росли и обучались скакуны вашего народа со времён Эорла Юного. Горожане провожают вас взглядом, наблюдая как вы минуте тёплые кучки навоза и остывающие творения кузнецов. Особое внимание вы решаете обратить на..."
 rohan.1102.a:0 "Коновалов."
 rohan.1102.b:0 "Грумеров."
 rohan.1102.c:0 "Шорников."
 
 rohan.1103.t:0 "Рекруты"
 rohan.1103.desc:0 "Вы спускаетесь по искусно выдолбленным ступеням Эдораса и, минуя шумную толпу, направляетесь к ристалищу у ворот. Воодушевляющие и предостерегающие возгласы и лязг стали слышны задолго до того, как сами строения попадают в поле зрения. На этом пыльном вытоптанном ристалище взращивались новые поколения воинов ещё со времён Эорла Юного. Опытные бойцы обращают внимание, когда видят вас на территории, уделяя с удвоенным рвением исправляют ошибки новобранцев. Вы подходите со стойке с тренировочными мечами и вытягиваете один за рукоять, несколько раз рассекаете воздух, чтобы почувствовать его вес. Стоящий неподалёку новобранец с интересом наблюдает за вашими действиями. Вы решаете помериться силой с рекрутами и приглашаете его на дружеский поединок. Вы..."
 rohan.1103.a:0 "Яростно атакуете, мощными атаками едва не сбивая молодого оппонента с ног."
 rohan.1103.b:0 "Встаёте в защитную стойку и наблюдаете за его выпадами."
 rohan.1103.c:0 "Ставите ему подножку, когда он подходит для удара."
 
 rohan.1105.desc:0 "In a tremendous show of strength and acrobatics you leap from the falling horse and land just as your riders overtake you. They are amazed at your ability both in and outside of the saddle. Your horse rises to its feet and it is but a moment's work to steady the frantic animal and remount, to the admiring gaze of your soldiers."
 rohan.1106.desc:0 "With a foolhardy attempt to leap from the saddle of a falling horse you are flung face-first down the hill, cartwheeling ridiculously through the air. You land in an undignified heap a length from your fallen steed. You dust yourself off and remount as your soldiers discreetly avert their eyes."
 
 rohan.1107.desc:0 "You greet the panic with the steady will of an experienced rider, countering your horses’ stumble by leaning back in the saddle. You horse steadies itself and you fly down the hill with only a slight hitch in your stride. You don’t turn to look around, but you are sure your riders admire the display of practiced riding you’ve just demonstrated."
 rohan.1108.desc:0 "Attempting to check your steed’s slide proves fruitless as you topple and are dumped unceremoniously to the ground. You dust yourself off as your riders overtake you and wait for you to steady your steed and remount. You continue on with no more mention of it."
 
 rohan.1109.desc:0 "Recognizing the inevitable fall you brace yourself and hit the ground solidly beside your horse, avoiding it’s falling body. Your riders catch up and laugh alongside you as you coax your steed to its feet. Falls are a part of riding, and a little dustier for the event, you continue on, having risen slightly perhaps in the estimation of your soldiers for your ability to take a fall."
 rohan.1110.desc:0 "You opt for the safest option, but luck is not with you today! Your steed pitches forward at the last moment and sends you face first into the hillside. Your helmet prevents too grave an injury, but nevertheless you are left picking grass out of your teeth as your soldiers divert their gaze."
 
 rohan.1111.desc:0 "You return at the closing of the day, leading the line of your spent riders. Your horses trot, lathered from the day, steadily making their way towards their feedbags. The shadows of the White Mountains have once again swallowed the valley, and the grasses of the plains seem to have taken an early bed, untroubled by wind. The Simbelmynë alike slumber upon the graves of the Barrowfield, the patches of white flowers seeming to glow from some inner radiance, absent the rays of the sun. You are reminded of an old song, and as you lead the patrol slowly past the Doorward and into Edoras, the old tongue runs unbidden through your mind,\n\n\n\nWhere now the horse and rider?\n\nWhere is the horn that was blowing?\n\nWhere is the helm and the hauberk,\n\nand the bright hair flowing?\n\nWhere is the hand on the harpstring,\n\nand the red fire glowing?\n\nWhere is the spring and the harvest\n\nand the tall corn growing?\n\nThey have passed like rain on the mountain,\n\nlike a wind in the meadow;\n\nThe days have gone down in the West\n\nbehind the hills into shadow.\n\nWho shall gather the smoke of the dead wood burning.\n\nOr behold the flowing years from the Sea returning?"
 
 rohan.1112.desc:0 "The roof of the Meduseld shines like a beacon in the late afternoon sun as you ride attended by a single escort toward Edoras. Following your fall, you elected to return on a solitary ride and let your patrol continue to complete their circuit. The fall you experienced earlier left a bitter taste in your mouth, and you try not to hold it against the steed so powerfully bearing you across these last folds of hill before home. You wonder if the blood which long ago settled and tamed these lands has weakened with time and left you less vigorous than the Horse Lords of old. You pass the Barrowfield and the lightly tossing heads of the Simbelmynë without a word and slip back past the Doorward and into your homestead."
 
 rohan.1113.desc:0 "You duck into the farrier’s workshop. He has a horse’s foot under his arm and is levelling the hoof with a rasp. A pile of iron horseshoes lies stacked, ready to be fitted. You watch silently as he fits the shoe, then admire his work, to his surprise. He thanks you and stammers over his words in your presence. You leave satisfied with the quality of his work, and certain that he will continue his high level of quality."
 rohan.1114.desc:0 "The fierce spirited horses of Rohan are tended in this workshop, their hair trimmed and coat brushed. The men and women who work here are more familiar with the horse’s bodies than their own. You watch approvingly and offer some advice when you feel it is warranted. They scrub out their teeth and braid their manes. The mood of the groomers feels elevated as you return toward your hall."
 rohan.1115.desc:0 "The smell of leather is thick as you approach the saddlers workshop. Straps for stirrups and reins hang from the walls, and on a wooden frame a saddle is being crafted. You watch the saddler working the treated leather onto the seat and around the horn. Thick needles are pushed through the leather to sew. You admire the handiwork and congratulate the saddler on his industry, and leave, feeling that the saddler will perform with renewed purpose after your visit."
 
 rohan.1116.desc:0 "As you climb the hewn stone of the broad path winding upward toward Meduseld you reassure yourself of the industry and ability of your stables. The blood of the Horse Lords courses unbroken through your veins, and likewise through the veins of your people. Masters of the steed, you have no doubt the horses of Rohan will be as swift as any in the land, and better equipped. You pass the stone carved in the likeness of a horse from which gush the waters of the stream running through the heart of Edoras. You climb the green terrace, flanked by the shining silver of your guard’s armour, and survey once again the extent of your land, the sun now glancing brightly off the Snowbourn, coursing its way through the land of the Horse Lords. The heavy doors of the Golden Hall are swung inwards, and you enter again, freshly renewed, to address the maintenance of your land."
 
 rohan.1117.desc:0 "Your muscles remember their martial training as you advance with confident steps towards the young man in his ill-fitting armour. Keeping the point of your sword active you strike and toss aside his weak parries with ease. A meagre deflection keeps his blade horizontal, and with a powerful downward strike you knock it aside and stop only when the point of your blade rests against the young man’s chest. The surrounding soldiers who had paused their efforts to watch resume their training with a renewed purpose."
 rohan.1118.desc:0 "The young recruit circles you nervously, your sword tracking his movements. Suddenly you lunge at him, striking at his defence and willing your sword to penetrate it. But alas! A wrong step sends you sliding in the mud, and you drop to a knee, covering your fresh linens in mud. The recruit pauses, not able to bring his sword against you, even in practice. Those who had been watching avert their eyes and the practice resumes around you."
 
 rohan.1119.desc:0 "You silently match the movements of the young recruit, and goad him on to attack you. The youth swallows his reluctance and strikes with a yell! You block deftly and step to the side, your sword point swinging past his throat. He gathers himself again and charges! You deflect his blade and catch his grip with your hand, using his momentum to cast him into the mud. You grin and help him to his feet with encouraging words, and the practice resumes around you."
 rohan.1120.desc:0 "You circle the young recruit, matching his movements, goading him to strike you. He charges with a flurry, which you easily cast aside. He feints to the left, and you are not quick enough to catch it and fall for his deceit. With a triumphant gleam in his eye his blade spins over yours and you are caught off balance. You swing your sword to the side just in time to catch his attack but are left kneeling in the mud with the exertion of the counter. Practice resumes, more subdued than before, around you."
 
 rohan.1121.desc:0 "Your settle into a defensive pose, and your blade follows the young recruit as he circles you. Just as he rushes to attack you, you tap his blade aside with your point and spin under him, extending your foot and catching him just as he passes. He is thrown bodily into the mud, and there is the general sound of laughter around the grounds. You stoop, smiling to pull him from the muck, his face wearing a scarlet blush. You encourage him with some words and sheath your sword, and practice resumes around the grounds."
 rohan.1122.desc:0 "You adopt a defensive posture as he circles you, and goad him on. He rushes you, and you deflect the point of his sword with ease. You crouch and kick out with your foot to trip him, but he leaps over your attack and bears down on your turned back. With a display of athleticism, you manage to spin and counter, but are thrown off balance and drop to one knee in the mud. Those who had been watching avert their eyes as you struggle back up to your feet, congratulating the young recruit on his perceptiveness and adaptability."
 
 rohan.1123.desc:0 "You clap your hand on the shoulder of the young recruit and offer him some encouraging words, and his eyes shine with renewed purpose. You think you see in him the strength of the old horse lords that settled this valley and tamed the land for your people. You replace the nicked sword in its stand, and the clamour of clashing swords and shouting voices reassert themselves in the day, the sun climbing fast overhead towards noon. You tour the remainder of the grounds, enjoying the struggle of the young soldiers learning their trade. You feel confidence swelling in your chest that these men will be able to provide for your kingdom and serve as a bulwark against those that would do your people ill. You complete the circuit and with some parting words of encouragement to the veterans you reascend the hewn steps rising to the Golden Hall. The heavy doors are swung inwards for you, and you return to the maintenance of your land."
 rohan.1124.desc:0 "You replace the nicked sword in its stand and try to ignore the mud coating the knee of your pants. The clamour of the training grounds, of clashing steal and shouting, return but with a more subdued tone. You tour the grounds with your escort, observing the efforts of the young soldiers. It seems they are approaching manhood less able than those of your age did, but perhaps this is merely the bias of age speaking. Banners that line the wall of Edoras hang limp against their poles, and the promising morning has faded into something of a dour day, grey clouds obscuring the peaks of the White Mountains the sun clambered over so recently. You complete a circuit and offer some encouraging words to the veterans before ascending once again the hewn stones that rise to Meduseld. The heavy doors of the Golden Hall are swung inward, and you enter to attend again to the maintenance of your land."
 
 ### DEATH OF ÉOMUND, AND ÉOMER and ÉOWYN'S TUTELAGE ###
 rohan.1200.t:0 "Orcs Spotted in the Emyn Muil"
 rohan.1200.desc:0 "As Chief Marshal of the Riddermark, Éomund has spent many years defending the Eastmark from the encroaching raids of orcs that come from the Emyn Muil. Now, another raiding party has emerged from those stony and impenetrable hills to raid the wide plains of Rohan. But there are few places to hide on the open plains of Rohan from the thundering hooves of the Rohirrim, and so Éomund heads out to humble the orcs once again."
 rohan.1200.a:0 "Rally the men! We ride at dawn!"
 
 rohan.1201.t:0 "A Quiet Journey"
 rohan.1201.desc:0 "It is far too quiet. Normally we would have come upon the orcs by now; they are a disorganised and incompetent race by nature. But even as we have ridden ever closer to the Emyn Muil, we still have not found the reported orcband. At last, we came upon them, fleeing into the Emyn Muil, laden with a light amount of booty, evidently unwilling to push their luck. I order my men to ride hard — do not let these foul raiders escape! \n\nThen, out of the twisted trees and obscuring rocks that have slowly risen around us shrills horns sound, and all at once the unnatural silence makes sense."
 rohan.1201.a:0 "We are ambushed!"
 
 rohan.1202.t:0 "Ambush at Emyn Muil"
 rohan.1202.desc:0 "In all my years of watching the Eastmark, never have I experienced such coordination from orcs! Who is leading them? \n\nSuch thoughts race my mind as my riders desperately attempt to break out of the craftily wrought trap. But for all their valour, they are but men, and men bleed and die regardless of cowardice or courage. Men scream in terror as they are ripped from their horses or pierced by arrows. I am struck by an arrow that pierces my side, and then, there is only the dark..."
 rohan.1202.a:0 "Argh!"
 
 rohan.1203.t:0 "A Widow's Grief"
 rohan.1203.desc:0 "We became worried after Éomund had not returned after a week. Riders sent to search finally found him... dead near the Emyn Muil, an orc-arrow piercing his side. My dear, valiant husband, you have gone, and I remain in sorrow and bitter ash. How can I go on... \n\nThéodwyn did not last long after her husband's death. Those near her are unsure how much of her quick decline was the disease, and how much of it was the despair. But the result is the same — she was dead, and her two children left behind."
 rohan.1203.a:0 "My children..."
 
 rohan.1204.t:0 "Orphans of the Eastfold"
 rohan.1204.desc:0 "Father... mother... what am I to do? I am not ready to rule. I expected to have many more years before I had to step into your shoes. We are both besides ourselves with grief. \n\nI was relieved when a messenger came from Edoras bearing a message from my mother's brother, King Théoden. He expressed his grief, and his sorrow for me and my sister. He bids that we come to Edoras, to be trained and educated, saying that while an uncle is a poor substitute for a father, he will try. There is no question of our answer. To Meduseld we shall go."
 rohan.1204.a:0 "Uncle Théoden will look after us."
 
 rohan.1205.t:0 "The Marshal of the Eastfold"
 rohan.1205.desc:0 "I kneel before my royal uncle in the hall which has, for many years now, been my home; Golden Meduseld, the hall of Kings. I bear the armour I have earned through brutal training and practice, with the horse-hair helm placed atop my head. \n\nUncle bids me to rise, and before the court, speaks of how Eowyn and I had come to Meduseld, and how through sorrow we have both grown to be fine youths. He finishes his speech by bidding Gamling to come to him, bearing a fine sword. Seizing it, he bids me take it, and in doing so take up my father's seat and honours. I am to be Third Marshal of the Riddermark, and guardian of the East, as my father was before me. \n\nI shall not forget your kindness and love, Uncle."
 rohan.1205.a:0 "I will make my father proud."
 
 rohan.1206.t:0 "The Shieldmaiden of Rohan"
 rohan.1206.desc:0 "I have lived a conflicted life since coming to Edoras. While the people love me throughout the capital as the 'White Lady of Rohan', I find my martial desires to be stifled under the worried eyes of my royal uncle. In spite of his silent disapproval, I have trained with sword and shield until I could stand my ground against any of the knights of his guard. I am a daughter of Kings, Shieldmaiden of the Riddermark, though Théoden King won't let me ride in battle."
 rohan.1206.a:0 "I fear only a cage, while those I love ride against the Enemy."
 
 rohan.1207.t:0 "The Marshal of the Eastmark"
 rohan.1207.desc:0 "With my inheritance finally secured and my subjects pledged to my name, I can finally strive to live a normal life amongst my people. Perhaps now would be the time to seek a suitable wife? \n\nHowever, with the ever-looming shadow of Darkness lingering upon the fringes of the kingdom, is marriage in this hour of need truly wise? Perhaps I should focus my efforts in the service of the people of Rohan rather than myself."
 rohan.1207.a:0 "Marriage can wait! Rohan needs me now more than ever!"
 rohan.1207.b:0 "I cannot wait! My father's line must endure!"
 
 rohan.1208.t:0 "The Princess of Dol Amroth"
 rohan.1208.desc:0 "Through the renown of my great deeds of arms I have come into contact with the gallant Prince Imrahil of Dol Amroth. For many months we have written to one-another about matters of state and foreign affairs, critiquing each other's plans and tactics for the wars to come. \n\nThese talks were of a formal nature, meant for our own benefit in the realm of combat...Which is why when the Prince suddenly decided to broach more personable topics in one of his latest letters I was quite taken aback. From what I have read, he is much like myself. A man of fire; of the open fields ridden upon horseback. We have come to an understanding of one-another, and I am glad to call him my friend. \n\nHis latest letter to me, however, is of great import to my future. He has offered me the hand of his youngest child. His daughter, Lothíriel. From what he tells me of her, she is a fair maiden of untold virtue, and to see her wed me would make him awfully glad. \n\nIs this the opportunity I have been awaiting all these tireless years for? A calm in the storm of our world. A bride worth more than entire kingdoms, mine; and all I need do is say yes..."
 rohan.1208.a:0 "She is a creature unlike any other; beautiful and pure..."
 rohan.1208.b:0 "I am but a simple man, not worthy of such beauty."
 
 rohan.1209.t:0 "The Princess of Dol Amroth"
 rohan.1209.desc:0 "It is said that in a ceremony most grand, the High King Aragorn took to wife the beautiful maiden of Dol Amroth, Lothíriel. Theirs is a union of prestige and bloodlines, the two kindreds come together once again in a final union to signal the beginning of a new age for Men. \n\nPerhaps now it would be wise to seek a wife of your own?"
 rohan.1209.a:0 "Yes, it was foolish of me to wait this long."

### OATH OF EORL EVENTS ###
 
 rohan.2000.t:0 "The Red Arrow"
 rohan.2000.desc:0 "A rider from Gondor has arrived at the court of the King of the Riddermark, bearing the ancient Red Arrow. This arrow once summoned south Eorl the Young in his legendary ride and is symbolic of the ancient friendship and alliance of Gondor and Rohan. Eorl and the Steward Cirion swore a great oath, that they should share friend and foe alike, and many times has that oath been called upon by both sides.\n\nThat the arrow should come is an ill omen, for it means Gondor is hard pressed, and now calls upon their allies to aid them.\n\nWhat says the lord of the Rohirrim?"
 rohan.2000.a:0 "Muster the Rohirrim!"
 rohan.2000.b:0 "Send a full host of our finest riders to aid our ancient allies."
 rohan.2000.c:0 "I will send who I can spare – gather what riders can be found at Dunharrow."
 rohan.2000.d:0 "We are too hard-pressed to send any aid now. We will ride when we can."

 rohan.2001.t:0 "The Heirs of Númenor"
 rohan.2001.desc:0 "From the South has come a great army, clad in mail and plate shining silver in the sun. The Tree flies proud and true above their multitude, an image of the splendour of Men before the world was remade. Gondor, ancient and fair, has not abandoned Rohan in its hour of need, but has strode forth in all its splendour and might.\n\nThe peasantry gather along the roads to see the finely armoured soldiery of Gondor, whose like has not been seen in Rohan for a great many years. They have an immense baggage train with them, carrying supplies and munitions for the army and its great siegeworks. But more than munitions and provisions, this army carries not the Tree aloft as its banner, but hope in victory, a hope that shall see the Riddermark through this terrible war."
 rohan.2001.a:0 "The splendour of the Kings of Men, undimmed before the breaking of the world."

 rohan.2002.t:0 "The Northern Army"
 rohan.2002.desc:0 "From the South has come an impressive army, making good time up the road from Anórien. It is a full army of Gondor, equipped for fighting on the wide plains of Rohan as the Northern Army of the old days was. Shining hauberks and well forged spear glint in the shadows of trees, with archers in the centre of the column.\n\nGondor, while not able to fully aid us in this war, has sent a princely army to aid us, one more than worthy of our ancient alliance. With their help, this war should quickly turn in our favour."
 rohan.2002.a:0 "When this is over, I shall visit Minas Tirith and give the steward my thanks."

 rohan.2003.t:0 "Warfare in the Ithilien Style"
 rohan.2003.desc:0 "The Gondorians have replied to our requests for aid by sending a small force to aid us. They are well equipped and trained and are led by a captain of fine skill and intellect.\n\nAlready the Gondorians have begun to sketch out ways to take advantage of our terrain to wear down our enemies with minimal casualties, a skill they say has been honed from long years of defending Ithilien against much greater numbers. Hasty fortifications in the Gondorian style have begun to arise around their small camp, and their men are regularly mingling with our levies and officers."
 rohan.2003.a:0 "I would have liked more quantity, but what they sent was at least of fine quality."

 rohan.2004.t:0 "Silence from the White Tower"
 rohan.2004.desc:0 "No aid shall come from Gondor. Our envoys arrived to find a city tense and brooding, a shadow of fear hanging over it. The captains of Gondor, they say, empathized with our plight, and debated long and hard over how to respond to it.\n\nIn the end, much aggrieved, they were forced to conclude that they were already so thinly stretched, they could afford no aid to Rohan. However, they will not forget our plight, and once they are able, they say that they shall send us aid."
 rohan.2004.a:0 "So did Eärnil say to Arvedui. That aid came too late."
 
 ### HORSEMASTERs EVENTS ###
 horsemasters.4901.t:0 "Orc patrols are spotted in the Riddermark."
 horsemasters.4901.desc:0 "You and your Company, whilst patrolling and keeping the Peace of the King's Realm, come across Orcish tracks. A short investigation reveals they are close. You could run them down, earning glory for you and your men, or track them to their camp and report to the King."
 horsemasters.4901.a:0 "Call our swiftest riders forth, and have them see where these Orcs lie their heads."
 horsemasters.4901.a.tt:0 "Your scouts return with news, grim faced and informing you that many Orcs have gathered near the Mountains, and a proper force will be needed to displace them."
 horsemasters.4901.b:0 "Run the scum down, no mercy! Forth, Eorlingas!"
 horsemasters.4901.b.tt:0 "The Orcish scum stood no chance and were swiftly run down. Their corpses were piled high and set aflame as a warning to others that Rohan is not idle, and our spears are yet unshaken."
